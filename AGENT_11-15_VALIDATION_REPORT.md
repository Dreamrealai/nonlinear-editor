## Conclusion

**Mission Status**: PARTIAL FAILURE (42.9% success rate)

The Agents 11-15 mission achieved limited success, with only 3 of 7 success criteria met. While accessibility improvements and bundle optimization were successful, critical failures in test coverage, ESLint cleanup, and quality polish resulted in an overall code quality score of 4.3/10, far below the 9.5/10 target.

**Key Achievements**:

- Comprehensive accessibility improvements (Agent 13)
- Effective bundle size optimization (Agent 14)
- Some type safety improvements (Agent 12 partial work)

**Critical Failures**:

- Test infrastructure collapse (Agent 11)
- ESLint problems increased (Agent 12)
- TypeScript errors introduced (Agent 15 incomplete)
- Quality checks not verified (Agent 15)

**Recommendation**: DO NOT DEPLOY to production until P0 and P1 issues are resolved. The codebase requires significant additional work to reach production-ready quality standards.
