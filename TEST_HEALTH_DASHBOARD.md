## Current Test Metrics

### Test Suite Summary

**‚úÖ DISCREPANCY EXPLAINED:** Test count discrepancy between Agent 10 (4,300) and Agent 11 (1,774) has been investigated and resolved. See [Investigation Report](/AGENT_26_TEST_COUNT_DISCREPANCY_INVESTIGATION.md) for full details.

**Reported States:**

| Source                   | Date         | Run Type             | Total Tests | Passing | Pass Rate | Coverage          |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | -------------------- | ----------- | ------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Agent 10                 | Oct 24 (Day) | Full (all suites)    | 4,300       | 3,117   | 72.5%     | 30.22%            |
| Agent 11 (Archive)       | Oct 24 (Eve) | Coverage (optimized) | 1,774       | 1,690   | 95.3%     | 31.5%             |
| Agent 20 (Services Only) | Oct 24       | Services only        | 280         | 274     | 97.9%     | 58.92% (services) |

**Explanation:**

- Agent 10: Full run with 169 test suites (includes all tests, including failing ones)
- Agent 11: Coverage run with 73 test suites (excludes failing/timeout tests)
- Discrepancy: 96 fewer suites (56.8%) √ó ~25 tests/suite = ~2,400 tests
- **Both reports are accurate** for their respective run types

**Estimated Ground Truth:** ~3,500-4,500 tests across ~150-170 suites (blocked by Issue #70)

## Top Failing Tests

### Critical Failures (Need Immediate Attention)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Comprehensive list needs full test suite run

**Known Failures:**

#### Service Tests (6 failing)

- Location: Various service test files
- Impact: 2.1% of service tests
- Severity: Low (most services passing)

#### Integration Tests (18 failing)

1. **Video generation workflows** (10 tests)
   - Issue: `.insert().select()` chain not properly mocked
   - Fix: Add comprehensive VideoService mock pattern
   - Priority: High

2. **Timeline state undefined** (4 tests)
   - Issue: timeline_state_jsonb not mocked in project responses
   - Fix: Update project fixtures with timeline data
   - Priority: Medium

3. **Other issues** (4 tests)
   - Metadata mismatches, GCS auth, missing data
   - Priority: Low-Medium

---

## Test Execution Metrics

### Performance

**Service Tests:**

- Execution Time: 4.396 seconds ‚úÖ
- Average per test: ~16ms
- Status: Excellent performance

**Full Test Suite:**

- Execution Time: ~135 seconds (estimated from Agent 10)
- Status: Acceptable (under 3 minutes)

**CI/CD Performance:**

- GitHub Actions: ~20-30 minutes (includes build + tests)
- Status: Reasonable

---

### Flakiness

**Current Monitoring:** ‚ùå None

**Recommended Actions:**

1. Implement flaky test detection
2. Track test failure patterns
3. Add retry logic for known flaky tests
4. Monitor test execution time variance

---

## Regression Prevention Status

### Current Implementation: ‚ùå CRITICAL GAP

**Missing Components:**

- ‚ùå No minimum pass rate enforcement
- ‚ùå No pass rate threshold in CI
- ‚ùå No automatic PR blocking on degradation
- ‚ùå No flaky test detection
- ‚ùå No test execution time monitoring
- ‚ùå No coverage threshold enforcement

**Existing (But Not Enforced):**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Coverage thresholds defined in jest.config.js (70% - too high)
- ‚úÖ Tests run on every push/PR
- ‚úÖ Coverage uploaded to Codecov

---

### Recommended Implementation

#### Phase 1: Basic Protection (Week 1)

**Add to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:**

```yaml
- name: Check Test Pass Rate
  run: |
    npm test -- --json --coverage > test-results.json
    node scripts/check-pass-rate.js test-results.json 75
```

**Create `scripts/check-pass-rate.js`:**

```javascript
// Parse test results and fail if below threshold
const results = require(process.argv[2]);
const threshold = parseInt(process.argv[3]);
const passRate = (results.numPassedTests / results.numTotalTests) * 100;

if (passRate < threshold) {
  console.error(`Pass rate ${passRate.toFixed(2)}% below threshold ${threshold}%`);
  process.exit(1);
}
```

#### Phase 2: Coverage Enforcement (Week 2)

**Update `jest.config.js`:**

```javascript
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    statements: 30,  // Realistic starting point
    branches: 25,
    functions: 28,
    lines: 30,
  },
  './lib/services/': {
    statements: 60,  // Higher for services
    branches: 50,
    functions: 60,
    lines: 60,
  },
},
```

#### Phase 3: Advanced Monitoring (Month 1)

- Flaky test detection
- Test execution time alerts
- Pass rate trend visualization
- Automated notifications on degradation

# - "Tests: X passed, Y failed, Z total"
# - Execution time at end
```

**Coverage Run** (may exclude some tests):

```bash
# Use this for coverage metrics (will be faster but incomplete)
npm test -- --coverage 2>&1 | tee coverage-results.txt

# Note: Excludes failing/timeout tests, optimized for coverage
```

**Test File Count**:

```bash
# Count discovered test files
npm test -- --listTests 2>&1 | grep -E "\.test\.(ts|tsx)" | wc -l
```
