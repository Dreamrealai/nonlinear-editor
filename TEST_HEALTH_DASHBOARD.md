## Top Failing Tests

### Critical Failures (Need Immediate Attention)

**⚠️ Note:** Comprehensive list needs full test suite run

**Known Failures:**

#### Service Tests (6 failing)

- Location: Various service test files
- Impact: 2.1% of service tests
- Severity: Low (most services passing)

#### Integration Tests (18 failing)

1. **Video generation workflows** (10 tests)
   - Issue: `.insert().select()` chain not properly mocked
   - Fix: Add comprehensive VideoService mock pattern
   - Priority: High

2. **Timeline state undefined** (4 tests)
   - Issue: timeline_state_jsonb not mocked in project responses
   - Fix: Update project fixtures with timeline data
   - Priority: Medium

3. **Other issues** (4 tests)
   - Metadata mismatches, GCS auth, missing data
   - Priority: Low-Medium

---

## Test Execution Metrics

### Performance

**Service Tests:**

- Execution Time: 4.396 seconds ✅
- Average per test: ~16ms
- Status: Excellent performance

**Full Test Suite:**

- Execution Time: ~135 seconds (estimated from Agent 10)
- Status: Acceptable (under 3 minutes)

**CI/CD Performance:**

- GitHub Actions: ~20-30 minutes (includes build + tests)
- Status: Reasonable

---

### Flakiness

**Current Monitoring:** ❌ None

**Recommended Actions:**

1. Implement flaky test detection
2. Track test failure patterns
3. Add retry logic for known flaky tests
4. Monitor test execution time variance

---

## Regression Prevention Status

### Current Implementation: ❌ CRITICAL GAP

**Missing Components:**

- ❌ No minimum pass rate enforcement
- ❌ No pass rate threshold in CI
- ❌ No automatic PR blocking on degradation
- ❌ No flaky test detection
- ❌ No test execution time monitoring
- ❌ No coverage threshold enforcement

**Existing (But Not Enforced):**

- ⚠️ Coverage thresholds defined in jest.config.js (70% - too high)
- ✅ Tests run on every push/PR
- ✅ Coverage uploaded to Codecov

---

### Recommended Implementation

#### Phase 1: Basic Protection (Week 1)

**Add to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:**

```yaml
- name: Check Test Pass Rate
  run: |
    npm test -- --json --coverage > test-results.json
    node scripts/check-pass-rate.js test-results.json 75
```

**Create `scripts/check-pass-rate.js`:**

```javascript
// Parse test results and fail if below threshold
const results = require(process.argv[2]);
const threshold = parseInt(process.argv[3]);
const passRate = (results.numPassedTests / results.numTotalTests) * 100;

if (passRate < threshold) {
  console.error(`Pass rate ${passRate.toFixed(2)}% below threshold ${threshold}%`);
  process.exit(1);
}
```

#### Phase 2: Coverage Enforcement (Week 2)

**Update `jest.config.js`:**

```javascript
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    statements: 30,  // Realistic starting point
    branches: 25,
    functions: 28,
    lines: 30,
  },
  './lib/services/': {
    statements: 60,  // Higher for services
    branches: 50,
    functions: 60,
    lines: 60,
  },
},
```

#### Phase 3: Advanced Monitoring (Month 1)

- Flaky test detection
- Test execution time alerts
- Pass rate trend visualization
- Automated notifications on degradation
