## ‚úÖ What's Configured

- **SMTP Host:** smtp.resend.com
- **SMTP Port:** 465 (SSL)
- **Sender Email:** onboarding@resend.dev (Resend test email - no verification needed!)
- **Sender Name:** Nonlinear Video Editor
- **Email Rate Limit:** 100 emails/hour
- **Production URL:** https://nonlinear-editor-8as1xg8gf-dream-real-b2bc4dd2.vercel.app
- **Vercel Environment:** RESEND_API_KEY added to production & preview

## üéâ Emails Are Working!

Since we're using Resend's test email (`onboarding@resend.dev`), **no domain verification is required**. You can start using email features immediately:

1. Sign up for an account
2. Receive confirmation email
3. Reset password via email

## Optional: Custom Domain Setup

If you want to use a custom domain (like `noreply@yourdomain.com`), follow these steps:

### Step 1: Log in to Resend

Go to https://resend.com/login and sign in with your account.

### Step 2: Add Your Domain

1. Navigate to **Domains** in the Resend dashboard
2. Click **Add Domain**
3. Enter: `dreamreal.ai`
4. Click **Add**

### Step 3: Add DNS Records

Resend will provide DNS records to add to your domain:

1. **DKIM Record** - for email authentication
2. **SPF Record** - for sender verification
3. **DMARC Record** - for email policy (optional but recommended)

Add these records to your DNS provider (wherever dreamreal.ai is hosted):

**Example DNS Records:**
```
TXT resend._domainkey.dreamreal.ai    [DKIM value from Resend]
TXT dreamreal.ai                       v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
TXT _dmarc.dreamreal.ai                v=DMARC1; p=none; ...
```

### Step 4: Verify Domain

1. After adding DNS records, click **Verify** in Resend dashboard
2. DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours, but usually completes in a few minutes
3. Once verified, you'll see a green checkmark

## Current Setup (No Action Needed)

Your app is already configured to use Resend's test email (`onboarding@resend.dev`), which:
- ‚úÖ Works immediately without verification

Once your domain is verified:

1. Go to `/signup` on your app
2. Create a new account
3. Check your email for the confirmation link
4. Click the link to confirm your account
5. Sign in at `/signin`

## Troubleshooting
