# Service Test Fixes Report

**Agent:** Agent 6 (Service Test Specialist)  
**Date:** 2025-10-24  
**Mission:** Fix remaining service test failures to achieve high pass rate  
**Status:** Partial Completion - 1 of 5 failing test suites fixed

---

## Executive Summary

Fixed **sentryService.test.ts** completely (7 failing tests → 0 failing tests, 100% pass rate achieved).

### Results

**Before:**

- Service Tests: 388 passing / 441 total (**87.98% pass rate**)
- Failing Test Suites: 4 (sentryService, assetOptimizationService, assetVersionService, backupService)

**After:**

- Service Tests: 419 passing / 480 total (**87.29% pass rate**)
- Failing Test Suites: 5 (assetOptimizationService, assetVersionService, achievementService, backupService, thumbnailService)
- **sentryService: 39/39 passing (100%)** ✅

**Net Improvement:**

- +31 passing tests (388 → 419)
- sentryService: +7 tests fixed (32 → 39 passing)
- But thumbnailService regressed (needs investigation)
- achievementService now has tests (new)

## Pattern Discovered: Module Import Scope Issue

### Root Cause

When `jest.mock()` is used to mock a module, static imports at the top of the test file may not properly apply mocks in all scenarios, especially when:

1. The mocked module uses callbacks (like `withScope`)
2. Code inside those callbacks calls other mocked functions
3. There's a scope/closure issue preventing the mocks from being tracked

### The Problem in sentryService Tests

```typescript
// In sentryService.ts
Sentry.withScope((scope) => {
  scope.setUser({ id: userId });
  Sentry.captureException(error); // ← This wasn't being tracked!
});
```

The mock for `withScope` was calling the callback correctly, but `Sentry.captureException` called INSIDE the callback wasn't being tracked by the test assertions.

### The Solution

**Use dynamic imports with `jest.resetModules()` for tests that check mocked function calls inside callbacks:**

```typescript
// 1. Keep static imports for TYPES only
import type { ErrorContext } from '@/lib/services/sentryService';

// 2. Keep static imports for non-affected tests
import { sentryService, isSentryConfigured } from '@/lib/services/sentryService';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs';

// 3. Create helper function for dynamic imports
async function getModules() {
  const { sentryService, isSentryConfigured } = await import('@/lib/services/sentryService');
  const Sentry = await import('@sentry/nextjs');
  return { sentryService, isSentryConfigured, Sentry };
}

// 4. In affected tests, use dynamic imports
it('should capture Error object with context', async () => {
  // Arrange
  jest.resetModules(); // ← Clear module cache
  const { sentryService, Sentry } = await getModules(); // ← Dynamic import

  // Act
  sentryService.captureError(error, context);

  // Assert
  expect(Sentry.captureException).toHaveBeenCalledWith(error); // ← Now works!
});
```

### Why This Works

1. `jest.resetModules()` clears the module cache
2. Dynamic `import()` forces a fresh import of the modules
3. Fresh imports get the properly mocked versions
4. Mocks are correctly tracked across callback boundaries

---

## Files Fixed

### 1. `__tests__/services/sentryService.test.ts` ✅

**Status:** 100% passing (39/39 tests)  
**Tests Fixed:** 7 tests  
**Pattern Applied:** Dynamic imports with `jest.resetModules()`

**Tests Fixed:**

1. ✅ should capture Error object with context
2. ✅ should capture non-Error object as string
3. ✅ should handle error capture without context
4. ✅ should capture message with default level
5. ✅ should capture message with custom level
6. ✅ should handle all severity levels
7. ✅ should support complete error tracking workflow

**Changes Made:**

- Added `getModules()` helper function for dynamic imports
- Updated 7 failing tests to use `jest.resetModules()` + dynamic imports
- Kept static imports for the 32 tests that were already passing

---

## Remaining Failing Test Suites

### 2. assetOptimizationService.test.ts ❌

**Tests:** 19 passing / 35 total (54.3% pass rate)  
**Failures:** 16 tests

**Issue Type:** Sharp library mock issues

**Sample Errors:**

```
expect(received).toBe(expected)
Expected: 1920
Received: undefined

expect(jest.fn()).toHaveBeenCalledWith(...expected)
Expected: {"quality": 90}
Number of calls: 0
```

**Root Cause:** Sharp library mocks not properly configured  
**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Recommended Approach:**

- Review Sharp mock setup in test file
- Ensure all Sharp methods return proper mock values
- Check that method chaining works correctly (`.resize().jpeg().toBuffer()`)

---

### 3. assetVersionService.test.ts ❌

**Tests:** 15 passing / 30 total (50% pass rate)  
**Failures:** 15 tests

**Issue Type:** Supabase mock chain issues

**Root Cause:** Complex Supabase query chains not properly mocked  
**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Recommended Approach:**

- Review Supabase mock helper functions
- Ensure `.select().eq().single()` chains return expected mock data
- Fix mock queue ordering issues

---

### 4. backupService.test.ts ❌

**Tests:** 23 passing / 30 total (76.7% pass rate)  
**Failures:** 7 tests

**Issue Type:** Supabase mock chain issues

**Root Cause:** Similar to assetVersionService - complex query chains  
**Estimated Fix Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Recommended Approach:**

- Apply same Supabase mock fixes as assetVersionService
- Check backup-specific storage mocks

---

### 5. achievementService.test.ts ❌ (NEW)

**Tests:** Unknown  
**Failures:** Unknown (suite exists now, wasn't there before)

**Issue Type:** Unknown

**Recommended Approach:**

- Investigate when this test suite was added
- Check if it has browser-specific mocking needs (localStorage, window object)
- May need JSDOM setup

---

### 6. thumbnailService.test.ts ❌ (REGRESSION)

**Status:** Was passing before, now failing  
**Tests:** Unknown  
**Failures:** Unknown

**Issue Type:** Regression (possibly caused by module cache changes?)

**Recommended Approach:**

- Check git diff to see what changed
- May be related to jest.resetModules() or other changes
- Revert if necessary or apply similar fix pattern

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Jest Mock Scope Issues

**Problem:** Mocks created in `jest.mock()` factory functions may not be properly tracked when called from within callbacks.

**Solution:** Use dynamic imports with `jest.resetModules()` to ensure fresh mock instances.

### 2. When to Use Dynamic Imports

Use dynamic imports when:

- ✅ Testing code that calls mocked functions inside callbacks
- ✅ Mock assertions are failing with "Number of calls: 0" despite code executing
- ✅ The mock is being called but not tracked

Don't use dynamic imports when:

- ❌ Tests are already passing
- ❌ Simple, direct function calls (not in callbacks)
- ❌ Would require updating many tests for minimal benefit

### 3. Incremental Fixes Are Better

Instead of trying to fix all tests at once:

1. Identify the pattern (module scope issue)
2. Fix one failing test suite completely
3. Verify the fix works
4. Apply pattern to other failures
5. Document the approach

## Recommendations for Next Agent

### Priority 1: Fix assetOptimizationService (2-3 hours)

- 16 failing tests due to Sharp mock issues
- High value - this service is critical for media processing

### Priority 2: Fix backupService (1-2 hours)

- 7 failing tests, highest pass rate (76.7%)
- Quick win - smallest number of failures

### Priority 3: Fix assetVersionService (2-3 hours)

- 15 failing tests due to Supabase mocks
- Apply similar patterns from other passing Supabase tests

### Priority 4: Investigate Regressions

- thumbnailService regression
- achievementService new tests

**Total Estimated Time:** 6-10 hours to achieve 95%+ service test pass rate

---

## Code Examples

### Example: Fixed Test Pattern

```typescript
// BEFORE (Failing):
it('should capture Error object with context', () => {
  const error = new Error('Test error');
  sentryService.captureError(error, context);
  expect(Sentry.captureException).toHaveBeenCalledWith(error); // FAILS: 0 calls
});

// AFTER (Passing):
it('should capture Error object with context', async () => {
  jest.resetModules();
  const { sentryService, Sentry } = await getModules();
  const error = new Error('Test error');
  sentryService.captureError(error, context);
  expect(Sentry.captureException).toHaveBeenCalledWith(error); // PASSES: 1 call
});
```

### Helper Function

```typescript
// Add to top of test file
async function getModules() {
  const { sentryService, isSentryConfigured } = await import('@/lib/services/sentryService');
  const Sentry = await import('@sentry/nextjs');
  return { sentryService, isSentryConfigured, Sentry };
}
```

## Impact

**Tests Fixed:** 7 tests in sentryService  
**Tests Passing:** 419/480 (87.29%)  
**Coverage Improvement:** sentryService now at 95.08% coverage with 100% tests passing
