# Project Memory

## Git Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: After every code update or change:

1. **Build the project** - Always run the build command to ensure the code compiles without errors
2. **Commit changes** - Create a git commit with a descriptive message
3. **Push to remote** - Push the changes to the git remote repository

### Automated Workflow

When making changes to this project:
1. Run `npm run build` to build the Next.js application with Turbopack
2. Verify the build succeeds without errors
3. Stage changes with `git add .`
4. Create a commit: `git commit -m "descriptive message"`
5. Push to remote: `git push`

This ensures all changes are properly built, tested, and version controlled before being pushed to the repository.
