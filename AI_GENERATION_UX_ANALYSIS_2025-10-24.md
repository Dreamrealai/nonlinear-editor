## Detailed Issue Analysis

### VIDEO GENERATION UX (12 issues)

#### Issue #47: No Visual Feedback for Model Capabilities

- **Priority:** P1 (Important)
- **Location:** `/components/generation/VideoGenerationForm.tsx:82-99`
- **Effort:** Small (2-3h)

**User Goal:** Users want to select the best model for their needs without trial and error.

**Pain Point:** Model dropdown shows only model names (e.g., "Veo 3.1 (Latest)", "Veo 3.1 Fast") with no indication of what features each supports. Users must:

1. Select a model
2. Try to configure settings
3. Discover settings are disabled/hidden
4. Switch models and reconfigure

**Interaction Design Problem:**

- No tooltips showing model capabilities
- No visual indicators (badges, icons) for supported features
- Settings UI changes but users don't understand why
- Model descriptions only show version, not capabilities

**Visual Hierarchy:** Model capabilities should be immediately visible alongside model selection, not discovered through trial and error.

**Efficiency:** Power users waste time switching between models to compare capabilities.

**Accessibility:** Screen reader users get no context about model differences.

**Specific Improvements:**

1. Add capability badges to dropdown options:

   ```
   Veo 3.1 (Latest) [✓ Ref Image] [✓ Audio] [8s max]
   Veo 3.1 Fast [✓ Ref Image] [✓ Audio] [8s max]
   Veo 2.0 [✓ Ref Image] [No Audio] [8s max]
   ```

2. Add capability summary below selector:

   ```
   Selected: Veo 3.1
   Capabilities: Reference images ✓ | Audio generation ✓ | 4-8s duration |
                 Negative prompts ✓ | 1080p resolution ✓
   ```

3. Add model info tooltip with full details:
   - Speed: Fast/Standard/Slow
   - Quality: Standard/High/Premium
   - Features list with checkmarks
   - Cost per generation (if applicable)

---

#### Issue #48: Queue Status Not Prominent Enough

- **Priority:** P1 (Important)
- **Location:** `/components/generation/VideoGenerationForm.tsx:265`
- **Effort:** Small (2-3h)

**User Goal:** Users need to know at a glance how much queue capacity remains.

**Pain Point:** Queue counter "7/8 videos in queue" is small neutral text at bottom of form. Users discover they're at capacity only when:

1. They fill out entire form with prompt and settings
2. Click "Add to Queue"
3. See error toast that queue is full

**Visual Hierarchy Problems:**

- Queue status has same weight as other form text
- No color coding to indicate urgency
- Hidden at bottom - not visible when scrolling form
- No progress bar visualization

**Error Prevention:** Users should see capacity warnings BEFORE spending time on prompts.

**Specific Improvements:**

1. Move queue status to prominent header position
2. Add progress bar visualization:

   ```
   Video Queue: [||||||||__] 7/8
   ```

3. Color-code based on capacity:
   - Green (0-4): "Queue available"
   - Yellow (5-6): "Queue filling up"
   - Red (7-8): "Queue almost full" with pulse animation

4. Disable form fields when queue is full (with clear message why)

5. Add estimated total queue time:
   ```
   Video Queue: 7/8 (~14-21 minutes remaining)
   ```

---

#### Issue #49: No Prompt Guidance or Examples

- **Priority:** P2 (Nice-to-have)
- **Location:** `/components/generation/VideoGenerationForm.tsx:246-259`
- **Effort:** Medium (4-6h)

**User Goal:** Users want to write effective prompts that generate high-quality videos.

**Pain Point:** Textarea shows single placeholder example: "A fast-tracking shot through a bustling dystopian sprawl...". No guidance on:

- What makes a prompt effective
- Recommended prompt length
- How specific/detailed to be
- Cinematography terminology
- Lighting/mood descriptors
- Subject/action/setting structure

**Impact:** Beginners write vague prompts ("a cat") or overly long prompts (paragraph of text), leading to poor results and frustration.

**Specific Improvements:**

1. Add expandable "✨ Prompt Tips" section above textarea:

   ```
   Tips for great videos:
   ✓ Be specific about subject, action, and setting
   ✓ Include camera movement (tracking shot, zoom, pan)
   ✓ Describe lighting and mood (golden hour, neon lights, soft shadows)
   ✓ Use 50-200 characters for best results
   ✓ Avoid overly complex scenes
   ```

2. Add example category buttons:

   ```
   [Cinematic] [Product] [Nature] [Abstract] [Random]
   ```

   Clicking fills textarea with category-appropriate example

3. Add "Magic Wand" AI enhancement button:
   - Takes short prompt: "cat playing"
   - Uses Gemini to expand: "A playful orange tabby cat batting at a yarn ball in a cozy living room, warm afternoon sunlight streaming through windows, shallow depth of field, slow motion capture"

4. Add character counter with guidance:
   ```
   Characters: 45/200 (Good - try adding camera movement)
   Characters: 156/200 (Excellent length)
   Characters: 287/200 (⚠️ Long prompts may be less accurate)
   ```

---

#### Issue #50: Advanced Settings Buried with No Preview

- **Priority:** P2 (Nice-to-have)
- **Location:** `/components/generation/VideoGenerationSettings.tsx:64-250`
- **Effort:** Medium (4-5h)

**User Goal:** Users want to quickly see and adjust quality/technical settings without hunting.

**Pain Point:** "Advanced Settings" section is collapsed by default showing only "Show/Hide" toggle. Users don't know:

- What settings exist (resolution, seed, negative prompt, etc.)
- Whether any advanced settings are currently active
- If they should expand and check settings

**Interaction Design:** Common pattern is to show preview of active non-default settings when collapsed.

**Specific Improvements:**

1. Show active settings count badge:

   ```
   Advanced Settings [3 active] [Show ▼]
   ```

2. Display mini-preview when collapsed:

   ```
   Advanced Settings [Show ▼]
   Currently: 1080p • Seed: 12345 • Enhance prompt
   ```

3. Consider promoting these to primary controls:
   - Resolution (very common adjustment)
   - Sample count (generate multiple versions)

4. Add "Reset to Defaults" button inside advanced section

5. Add tooltips on each setting explaining impact:
   - "Seed: Use same number to reproduce results"
   - "Negative prompt: Describe what to avoid"

---

#### Issue #51: No Video Generation Time Estimates

- **Priority:** P1 (Important)
- **Location:** Multiple: Form submit, queue items
- **Effort:** Medium (5-8h)

**User Goal:** Users want to know how long generation will take so they can plan their time.

**Pain Point:** No time estimates anywhere. Users don't know if generation takes:

- 30 seconds
- 5 minutes
- 30 minutes

This creates anxiety - users don't know if they should:

- Wait on the page
- Navigate away
- Start other work

**Performance Perception:** Showing estimates makes waits feel shorter even if actual time doesn't change.

**Specific Improvements:**

1. Show estimate on "Add to Queue" button hover:

   ```
   [Add to Queue]
   ↓ (on hover)
   [Add to Queue] ~2-3 minutes
   ```

2. Show per-model timing in model selector:

   ```
   Veo 3.1 (Latest)    ~3-5 min
   Veo 3.1 Fast        ~1-2 min ⚡
   ```

3. In queue items, show estimate and countdown:

   ```
   Status: Generating... (1:23 remaining of ~2:00)
   Status: Queued (2 videos ahead, ~4-6 minutes)
   ```

4. Update estimates based on historical data:
   - Track actual generation times per model/duration
   - Show "Usually 2-3 minutes" with 80th percentile
   - Warn if unusually slow: "Taking longer than usual"

5. Add total queue time in header:
   ```
   Video Queue: 5/8 (~10-15 minutes total)
   ```

---

#### Issue #52: Queue Grid Layout Issues on Smaller Screens

- **Priority:** P2 (Nice-to-have)
- **Location:** `/components/generation/VideoGenerationQueue.tsx:74`
- **Effort:** Small (2-3h)

**User Goal:** Users on different devices want to comfortably view their video queue.

**Pain Point:** Fixed 2-column grid (`grid-cols-2`) doesn't adapt:

- **Tablets (768px):** Videos too small in 2 columns
- **Desktop (1920px):** Wasted space with only 2 columns
- **Mobile (375px):** 2 columns makes videos tiny
- **Ultra-wide (2560px):** Huge wasted space

**Visual Hierarchy:** Video previews should be large enough to see content clearly.

**Specific Improvements:**

1. Use responsive grid:

   ```css
   grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4
   ```

   - Mobile (< 640px): 1 column (full width)
   - Tablet (640-1024px): 2 columns
   - Desktop (1024-1536px): 3 columns
   - Ultra-wide (> 1536px): 4 columns

2. Add view toggle in header:

   ```
   [Grid View 📱] [List View 📝]
   ```

   - Grid: Current thumbnail view
   - List: Compact rows with small thumbnail + details

3. Add user preference with localStorage:
   - Remember grid/list preference
   - Remember grid size preference

### AUDIO GENERATION UX (8 issues)

#### Issue #59: No Audio Playback in Generation UI ⚠️ CRITICAL

- **Priority:** P0 (Critical)
- **Location:** All audio generation forms
- **Effort:** Medium (8-10h)

**User Goal:** Users need to immediately hear their generated audio to validate results.

**Pain Point:** After generating music/voice/SFX:

1. Toast shows "Generated successfully!"
2. Audio file is saved to project
3. NO WAY to play audio in generation UI
4. Users must:
   - Navigate to asset library OR
   - Add to timeline and play there OR
   - Download and play locally

**Impact:** This is an EXTREMELY POOR user experience. Users:

- Can't validate if generation matches expectations
- Must regenerate if unhappy (wasting time/credits)
- Lose context switching between generation and playback
- Can't quickly iterate (generate → listen → adjust → regenerate)

**Error Prevention:** Users should hear results before deciding to regenerate or adjust.

**Specific Improvements:**

1. Add inline audio player that appears after successful generation:

   ```
   ✓ Generated successfully! [00:00 ▶️━━━━━ 02:47] 🔊 [⬇️ Download] [➕ Add to Timeline]
   ```

2. Show waveform visualization during playback

3. Keep last 3-5 generations accessible:

   ```
   Recent Generations:
   [▶️ 2:47] Upbeat electronic track
   [▶️ 1:23] Door knock sound effect
   [▶️ 3:15] Voice narration
   ```

4. Add quick actions:
   - Download audio file
   - Add to timeline at playhead
   - Regenerate with same settings
   - Save to favorites

### CROSS-CUTTING GENERATION UX (8 issues)

#### Issue #67: No Unified Generation Progress Dashboard

- **Priority:** P1 (Important)
- **Location:** Across all generation interfaces
- **Effort:** Large (20-24h)

**User Goal:** Users want to track ALL active AI operations from one place.

**Pain Point:** Inconsistent progress tracking:

- **Video:** Right panel queue with 8 slots visible
- **Audio:** Blocks UI with spinner, single operation only
- **Switching tabs:** Lose visibility of what's generating

Users with multiple operations must:

1. Remember what's generating
2. Switch tabs to check status
3. Can't prioritize across types
4. No notification when operations complete in background tab

**Efficiency:** Users should manage all AI operations without context switching.

**Specific Improvements:**

1. Add global "AI Operations" panel accessible from all tabs:

   ```
   [AI Operations] 🔔3
   ```

2. Show unified queue of all operation types:

   ```
   AI Operations (5 active)
   ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
   │ 🎬 Video: "Sunset beach scene"  │ ████░░ 67% ~1 min
   │ 🎵 Music: "Upbeat electronic"   │ ██░░░░ 34% ~2 min
   │ 🎤 Voice: "Narration intro"     │ ⏸️ Queued
   │ 🎬 Video: "Product closeup"     │ ✓ Complete
   │ 🔊 SFX: "Door knock"            │ ❌ Failed
   └─────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

3. Add filters:

   ```
   [All] [Video] [Audio] [In Progress] [Completed] [Failed]
   ```

4. Add notification badge when operations complete:

   ```
   [AI Operations] 🔔2 new
   ```

5. Make persistent across navigation - follows user through app
