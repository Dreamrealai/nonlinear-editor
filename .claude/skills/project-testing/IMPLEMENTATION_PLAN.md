**Effort:** 80 hours total
**Expected ROI:** 60% faster, 50% cheaper, 90% more reliable

---

## Quick Wins (Implement Today)

These improvements can be added to the skill documentation **immediately** without code changes:

### 1. Enhanced Agent Prompts (30 minutes)

**Current Issue:** Agent prompts are verbose and unfocused

**Improvement:**

```markdown
❌ BEFORE (500+ tokens):
"Test multi-track timeline features on production. Prerequisites: User is logged in,
project created, assets uploaded. Use Chrome DevTools MCP tools: 1. Take snapshot
to find timeline elements 2. Test drag-and-drop..."

✅ AFTER (150 tokens):
"Test timeline features.

Context: Authenticated, project ID: {projectId}, assets: {assetIds}

Tests:

1. Drag asset to timeline → mcp**chrome_devtools**drag
2. Zoom controls → check zoom slider
3. Snap toggle → verify grid alignment

Report: Pass/fail + errors[]"
```

**Benefits:**

- 70% token reduction
- Faster agent launch
- Clearer instructions

---

### 2. Error Handling Guidance (15 minutes)

Add to each agent prompt:

```markdown
Error Handling:

- Network/timeout errors: Retry 3x with 2s, 4s, 8s delays
- 4xx errors: Report immediately (don't retry)
- 5xx errors: Retry 2x with 5s delay
- Auth errors: Check session, re-login if expired
- Chrome DevTools timeout: Increase wait time to 10s
```

---

### 3. Context Management Instructions (15 minutes)

Add to skill:

```markdown
Context Management Protocol:

After each major phase:

1. Extract essential results only
2. Store in structured format
3. Use /clear command to reset context
4. Pass minimal context to next phase

Example:
Agent 1 completes → Extract: { authToken, userId }
/clear
Agent 2 starts with: "Auth token: {authToken}, User ID: {userId}"
```

---

### 4. Idempotency Guidelines (15 minutes)

Add to skill:

```markdown
Idempotency Rules:

1. Generate unique test run ID: test-${timestamp}-${random}
2. Name all test resources with ID:
   - Project: "Test Project {runId}"
   - Assets: "test-asset-{runId}-{index}"
3. Check for existing test run (git commit hash)
4. Clean up test data at end:
   - Delete test projects
   - Remove test assets
   - Clear browser storage
```

---

### 5. Performance Budget Documentation (10 minutes)

Add to Agent 5 (Playback) prompt:

```markdown
Performance Budgets (Core Web Vitals):

✅ Good:

- LCP < 2.5s
- FID < 100ms
- CLS < 0.1

⚠️ Needs Improvement:

- LCP 2.5-4s
- FID 100-300ms
- CLS 0.1-0.25

❌ Poor:

- LCP > 4s
- FID > 300ms
- CLS > 0.25

Report performance as P1 issue if any metric is Poor.
```

**Total Quick Wins:** 85 minutes
**Impact:** Immediate reliability improvement
**Deploy:** Update Skill.md and commit
