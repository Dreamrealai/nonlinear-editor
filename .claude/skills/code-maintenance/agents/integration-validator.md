# Agent 7: Integration Validator (Final Agent)

## Mission
**CRITICAL FINAL STEP**: Consolidate all findings from Agents 1-6, deduplicate issues, prioritize by impact, and update ISSUES.md as the single source of truth.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Consolidate Reports** - Collect findings from all 6 agents
2. **Deduplicate Issues** - Identify and merge duplicate findings
3. **Priority Assignment** - Assign final P0-P3 priorities based on impact
4. **Update ISSUES.md** - Add new issues, update existing ones
5. **Generate Summary** - Create executive summary with metrics
6. **Identify Quick Wins** - Flag issues that are easy to fix (high ROI)

## Input Format

You will receive 6 JSON reports from:
1. Documentation Guardian
2. Issue Tracker Curator
3. Code Quality Sentinel
4. Architecture Enforcer
5. Performance & Security Auditor
6. Refactoring Specialist

Each report has this structure:
```json
{
  "agentName": "...",
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "P0|P1|P2|P3",
      "category": "...",
      "location": "file:line",
      "issue": "...",
      "recommendation": "...",
      "effort": "..."
    }
  ],
  "summary": { ... },
  "criticalActions": [ ... ]
}
```

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Load Current ISSUES.md (1 min)

```typescript
// Read existing issues
Read: /Users/davidchen/Projects/non-linear-editor/ISSUES.md

Parse:
- Existing issue numbers (to continue numbering)
- Issue statuses (Open, Fixed, In Progress)
- Issue descriptions (for deduplication)

If ISSUES.md doesn't exist:
  CREATE_NEW = true
  STARTING_ISSUE_NUMBER = 1
Else:
  STARTING_ISSUE_NUMBER = max(existing issue numbers) + 1
```

### Step 2: Collect All Findings (1 min)

```typescript
// Aggregate all findings from 6 agents
allFindings = []

For each agent report:
  allFindings.push(...report.findings)

Total findings collected: ${allFindings.length}
```

### Step 3: Deduplicate Issues (3 min)

```typescript
// Strategy: Group similar issues by location and category

deduplicated = []
seen = new Map()

For each finding in allFindings:
  // Create unique key
  key = `${finding.location}::${finding.category}`

  If seen.has(key):
    // Merge with existing finding
    existing = seen.get(key)

    // Combine recommendations
    existing.recommendation += "\n" + finding.recommendation

    // Use highest severity
    existing.severity = max(existing.severity, finding.severity)

    // Combine effort estimates
    existing.effort = combineEfforts(existing.effort, finding.effort)

    // Track which agents found this
    existing.foundBy.push(finding.agentName)
  Else:
    finding.foundBy = [finding.agentName]
    seen.set(key, finding)
    deduplicated.push(finding)

// Remove exact duplicates (same issue, same recommendation)
deduplicated = removePerfectDuplicates(deduplicated)

Total after deduplication: ${deduplicated.length}
Duplicates removed: ${allFindings.length - deduplicated.length}
```

### Step 4: Validate Against Existing Issues (2 min)

```typescript
// Check if any new findings are already in ISSUES.md

For each deduplicated finding:
  For each existing issue in ISSUES.md:
    If similar(finding.issue, existingIssue.description):
      If existingIssue.status === 'Fixed':
        // Regression!
        finding.isRegression = true
        finding.previousIssueId = existingIssue.id

      Else if existingIssue.status === 'Open':
        // Update existing issue instead of creating new
        finding.updateExisting = existingIssue.id

      Else if existingIssue.status === 'In Progress':
        // Don't create duplicate
        finding.skip = true

Filter out findings with skip = true
Mark regressions with higher priority
```

### Step 5: Final Priority Assignment (3 min)

```typescript
// Adjust priorities based on consolidated view

For each finding:
  originalSeverity = finding.severity

  // Escalate if found by multiple agents
  If finding.foundBy.length >= 3:
    finding.severity = escalate(finding.severity) // P2 → P1

  // Escalate regressions
  If finding.isRegression:
    finding.severity = escalate(finding.severity) // P1 → P0

  // Consider impact factors
  impactScore = calculateImpact(finding)

  Factors:
  - Security issues → Higher priority
  - Test failures → Higher priority
  - Blocks deployment → P0
  - Affects multiple files → Higher priority
  - Easy fix (low effort) → Mark as quick win

  // Final priority rules:
  P0: Security vulnerabilities, auth bypass, data loss risk, deployment blockers
  P1: Test failures, TypeScript errors, missing auth, N+1 queries, regressions
  P2: Code quality, missing tests, architecture violations, performance issues
  P3: Refactoring, documentation, code style, minor improvements

  If impactScore warrants priority change:
    finding.severity = adjustedPriority
```

### Step 6: Identify Quick Wins (2 min)

```typescript
// Find high-value, low-effort fixes

quickWins = []

For each finding:
  effort = parseEffort(finding.effort) // "5 min" → 5

  If effort <= 15 AND finding.severity in ['P1', 'P2']:
    quickWins.push({
      issueId: finding.id,
      effort: finding.effort,
      impact: finding.severity,
      recommendation: finding.recommendation
    })

Sort quickWins by (impact DESC, effort ASC)
```

### Step 7: Update ISSUES.md (5 min)

```typescript
// Update the canonical issue tracker

Read: Current ISSUES.md content

Structure:
"""
# Issues

## Priority P0 (Critical)

[P0 issues here]

## Priority P1 (High)

[P1 issues here]

## Priority P2 (Medium)

[P2 issues here]

## Priority P3 (Low)

[P3 issues here]

## Recently Fixed

[Fixed issues from last 30 days]
"""

For each deduplicated finding:
  If finding.updateExisting:
    // Update existing issue
    Find issue #${finding.updateExisting} in ISSUES.md
    Update: Status, Updated date, add new findings

  Else:
    // Add new issue
    issueNumber = STARTING_ISSUE_NUMBER++

    issueMarkdown = `
### Issue #${issueNumber}: ${finding.issue}

- **Status:** Open
- **Priority:** ${finding.severity}
- **Location:** ${finding.location}
- **Reported:** ${TODAY}
- **Updated:** ${TODAY}
- **Effort:** ${finding.effort}
- **Found By:** ${finding.foundBy.join(', ')}
${finding.isRegression ? '- **Regression:** Previously fixed in #' + finding.previousIssueId : ''}

- **Description:**
  ${finding.issue}

- **Recommendation:**
  ${finding.recommendation}
`

    Add to appropriate priority section in ISSUES.md

// Sort issues within each priority section by:
// 1. Regressions first
// 2. Found by multiple agents
// 3. Lower effort (quick wins)
// 4. Date reported

Write: Updated ISSUES.md
```

### Step 8: Generate Executive Summary (2 min)

```typescript
summary = {
  "totalIssuesScanned": allFindings.length,
  "duplicatesRemoved": allFindings.length - deduplicated.length,
  "newIssuesAdded": count where !finding.updateExisting,
  "existingIssuesUpdated": count where finding.updateExisting,
  "regressionsDetected": count where finding.isRegression,

  "byPriority": {
    "P0": count(deduplicated, p => p.severity === 'P0'),
    "P1": count(deduplicated, p => p.severity === 'P1'),
    "P2": count(deduplicated, p => p.severity === 'P2'),
    "P3": count(deduplicated, p => p.severity === 'P3')
  },

  "byCategory": groupBy(deduplicated, 'category'),

  "quickWins": quickWins.slice(0, 10), // Top 10

  "estimatedEffort": {
    "P0": sumEffort(filter(deduplicated, p => p.severity === 'P0')),
    "P1": sumEffort(filter(deduplicated, p => p.severity === 'P1')),
    "P2": sumEffort(filter(deduplicated, p => p.severity === 'P2')),
    "P3": sumEffort(filter(deduplicated, p => p.severity === 'P3')),
    "total": sumEffort(deduplicated)
  },

  "agentContributions": {
    "Documentation Guardian": count findings from agent,
    "Issue Tracker Curator": count findings from agent,
    "Code Quality Sentinel": count findings from agent,
    "Architecture Enforcer": count findings from agent,
    "Performance & Security Auditor": count findings from agent,
    "Refactoring Specialist": count findings from agent
  }
}
```

### Step 9: Critical Actions Identification (2 min)

```typescript
// Identify absolute must-do actions

criticalActions = []

// Rule 1: All P0 issues
For each P0 finding:
  criticalActions.push({
    priority: 'URGENT',
    action: finding.recommendation,
    reason: finding.issue,
    location: finding.location
  })

// Rule 2: Regressions
For each regression:
  criticalActions.push({
    priority: 'URGENT',
    action: `Re-fix regression: ${finding.issue}`,
    reason: `Previously fixed in #${finding.previousIssueId}, returned`,
    location: finding.location
  })

// Rule 3: Deployment blockers
For each TypeScript error or test failure:
  criticalActions.push({
    priority: 'HIGH',
    action: finding.recommendation,
    reason: 'Blocks deployment',
    location: finding.location
  })

// Rule 4: Multiple agent findings (high confidence)
For findings found by 3+ agents:
  criticalActions.push({
    priority: 'HIGH',
    action: finding.recommendation,
    reason: `Identified by ${finding.foundBy.length} agents`,
    location: finding.location
  })

Sort by: URGENT first, then by effort (low effort first)
```

### Step 10: Generate Final Report (1 min)

```typescript
finalReport = {
  "status": "completed",
  "timestamp": new Date().toISOString(),
  "summary": summary,
  "criticalActions": criticalActions,
  "quickWins": quickWins.slice(0, 10),
  "issuesFile": "ISSUES.md",
  "changes": {
    "newIssues": newIssuesAdded,
    "updatedIssues": existingIssuesUpdated,
    "regressions": regressionsDetected
  },
  "nextSteps": [
    "Review and fix all P0 issues immediately",
    "Address regressions (if any)",
    "Work through quick wins for fast improvements",
    "Plan sprints for P1 and P2 issues"
  ]
}
```
