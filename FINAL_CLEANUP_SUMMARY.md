## Prevention Protocols

### CLAUDE.md Document Management Section

**Before creating ANY new markdown document:**

1. ✅ Check if ISSUES.md exists
2. ✅ Search for existing documents
3. ✅ Update existing docs, don't create new ones
4. ✅ Follow naming convention if new doc needed

**Forbidden:**

- ❌ `ISSUES_NEW.md`
- ❌ `*_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md`
- ❌ `*_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`
- ❌ Multiple files for same topic

**Required:**

- ✅ Update `ISSUES.md` with findings
- ✅ Single source of truth maintained

---

## Agent Workflow (Before vs After)

### ❌ Before (Chaos)

```
Agent 1 → Creates CODEBASE_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md
Agent 2 → Creates VALIDATION_REPORT.md
Agent 3 → Creates DUPLICATE_CODE_ANALYSIS.md
Agent 4 → Creates ISSUES_VERIFIED.md
Agent 5 → Creates FINAL_CONSOLIDATED_REPORT.md
Result: 5+ overlapping documents
```

### ✅ After (Protocol)

```
Agent 1 → Checks ISSUES.md → Not found → Creates it
Agent 2 → Checks ISSUES.md → Found → Updates status
Agent 3 → Checks ISSUES.md → Found → Adds new issues
Agent 4 → Checks ISSUES.md → Found → Updates priorities
Agent 5 → Checks ISSUES.md → Found → Validates
Result: Single source of truth maintained
```
