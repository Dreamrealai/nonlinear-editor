# Code Cleanup Summary - SecureStoryboard

## Date: May 30, 2025

### Files Removed/Archived
1. **test-blobs.js** → Moved to `_archived_test-blobs.js`
   - Test function for Netlify Blobs functionality
   - Not needed in production

2. **test-connection.js** → Moved to `_archived_test-connection.js`
   - Test function for Gemini API connectivity
   - Not needed in production

3. **check-env.js** → Moved to `_archived_check-env.js`
   - Environment variable checker (potentially exposes sensitive info)
   - Not needed in production

### Code Improvements

#### 1. Removed Unused Authentication Code
- Removed commented-out `verifyAuth` function from `generate-prompts.js`
- Authentication is disabled but the dead code was creating confusion

#### 2. Created MIME Type Utility
- Added `utils/mime-types.js` with `determineMimeType()` function
- Consolidated duplicate MIME type detection logic from:
  - `generate-prompts-direct.js` (4 instances)
  - `generate-prompts-start.js` (4 instances)

#### 3. Updated API Model References
- Changed from `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06` to `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` in:
  - `generate-prompts.js`
  - `generate-prompts-start.js`

#### 4. Reduced Console Logging
- Removed excessive debug logging from:
  - `generate-prompts-check.js` (4 console.log statements)
  - `utils/job-storage.js` (8 console.log statements)
- Kept only error logging and critical warnings

#### 5. Added Documentation
- Created `ARCHITECTURE.md` with comprehensive project structure documentation
- Added inline comments for complex logic

### Recommendations for Future Cleanup

1. **Consolidate Prompt Generation**
   - Currently have 5 different prompt generation endpoints
   - Consider consolidating to 2: direct and background

2. **Enable Authentication**
   - Authentication code exists but is disabled
   - Should be properly implemented before production use

3. **Improve Error Messages**
   - Some error messages are too technical for end users
   - Consider adding user-friendly error translations

4. **Add Request Validation**
   - Add schema validation for incoming requests
   - Prevent malformed data from reaching Gemini API

5. **Implement Rate Limiting**
   - No rate limiting currently implemented
   - Important for preventing API abuse

### Files NOT Modified
- UI files (HTML, CSS, client-side JS) - as requested
- Core functionality remains unchanged
- All user-facing features work exactly as before

### Testing Recommendations
After deployment, test:
1. File upload functionality (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT)
2. Two-step prompt generation
3. Background job processing for large requests
4. Error handling for network timeouts
5. Cold start behavior
