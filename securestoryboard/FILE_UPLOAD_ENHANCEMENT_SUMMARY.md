# Visual Style Elements - File Upload Enhancement Summary

## Changes Made (May 31, 2025)

### 1. **Expanded File Format Support**
The Visual Style Elements and Ad Brief upload features now support a much wider range of document formats:

#### Previously Supported:
- PDF (.pdf)
- Word (.doc, .docx)
- Text (.txt)

#### Now Also Supported:
- Rich Text Format (.rtf)
- OpenDocument Text (.odt)
- Markdown (.md)
- CSV (.csv)
- JSON (.json)
- XML (.xml)

### 2. **Improved File Handling**
- **MIME Type Detection**: Enhanced to properly detect and handle all new file formats
- **File Size Validation**: Added 10MB file size limit with user-friendly error messages
- **Text Content Extraction**: Automatically extracts text from text-based formats (TXT, MD, CSV, JSON, XML)
- **Better Error Handling**: Graceful handling of file reading errors

### 3. **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Informative Tooltips**: Upload buttons now show supported formats in tooltips
- **Placeholder Text**: Updated to mention file upload options (PDF, Word, TXT, etc.)

### 4. **Better AI Integration**
- **Explicit Style Instructions**: When a visual style file is uploaded, the AI receives special instructions to:
  - Carefully analyze the style document

  - Apply the style consistently across ALL generated scenes
- **Descriptive Context**: File uploads now include file type and size information for better AI understanding

### 5. **Auto-Save Enhancement**

- File uploads trigger auto-save to prevent loss of work

### 6. **Documentation**
- Created comprehensive guide: `VISUAL_STYLE_FILE_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md`
- Includes best practices, examples, and troubleshooting tips
