# Hybrid Approach Implementation Summary

**Date:** January 3, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Hybrid approach implemented, ‚ö†Ô∏è Async fallback has issues

## üéØ **What Was Implemented**

### 1. **Prompt Generation (genPromptBundle)**
- **First Attempt:** Uses `generate-prompts-simple` with 25s timeout
- **Fallback:** If timeout/error, switches to async `generate-prompts-gateway`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Working correctly

### 2. **Scene Analysis** 
- **First Attempt:** Uses `generate-prompts-simple` with 25s timeout
- **Fallback:** If timeout/error, switches to async pattern
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Working correctly

### 3. **Scene Modification**
- **Uses:** Direct `chat` endpoint only (as requested)
- **No Fallback:** Stays with chat endpoint
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Working as intended

## üîß **How It Works**

### For Simple/Fast Requests:
1. Tries direct endpoint with 25s timeout
2. Gets immediate response
3. No polling needed

### For Complex/Slow Requests:
1. Direct attempt times out after 25s
2. Automatically switches to async pattern
3. Creates job and polls for results
4. Can run for several minutes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Issue: Async Jobs Not Found**

### Console Errors Show:
```
404 (Not Found) for generate-prompts-check?jobId=job_1748673895924_kijxch01w
```

### Root Cause:
The async job storage isn't persisting properly. This is likely because:

1. **Netlify Blobs Not Active:** In local development, Netlify Blobs might not be properly configured
2. **In-Memory Fallback:** Jobs are stored in memory but lost between function invocations
3. **Cold Starts:** Each function call might be starting fresh without access to previous job data

## üöÄ **Testing Recommendations**

### 1. **Test Direct Approach:**
- Enter a short, simple brief
- Should complete within 25 seconds
- No async fallback needed

### 2. **Test on Deployed Site:**
- The async pattern should work better on the deployed Netlify site
- URL: https://imagestoryboard.netlify.app
- Netlify Blobs should be properly configured there

### 3. **Local Development Workaround:**
- Keep briefs shorter to avoid timeouts
- Or use `npx netlify dev` which better simulates the Netlify environment

## üìã **Code Structure**

### Prompt Generation Flow:
```javascript
try {
  // First: Try direct approach (25s timeout)
  const directResult = await apiCall('generate-prompts-simple', 'POST', {...}, 0, 25000);
  // Process result...
} catch (directError) {
  // Second: Fall back to async
  const gatewayResponse = await apiCall('generate-prompts-gateway', 'POST', {...});
  // Poll for results...
}
```

### Scene Analysis Flow:
```javascript
try {
  // First: Try direct approach (25s timeout)  
  const analysisResult = await apiCall('generate-prompts-simple', 'POST', {...}, 0, 25000);
  // Process result...
} catch (directError) {
  // Second: Fall back to async
  const gatewayResponse = await apiCall('generate-prompts-gateway', 'POST', {...});
  // Poll for results...
}
```

## ‚úÖ **Benefits of Hybrid Approach**

1. **Fast for Simple Requests:** No unnecessary polling
2. **Reliable for Complex Requests:** Can handle long operations
3. **User Experience:** Seamless transition between modes
4. **Best of Both Worlds:** Speed when possible, reliability when needed

## üîç **Next Steps**

To fix the async job storage issue:

1. **Verify Netlify Blobs Setup:**
   - Check if enabled in Netlify dashboard
   - Ensure proper environment variables
   - Test on deployed site

2. **Alternative Storage:**
   - Consider using a database service
   - Or implement webhook-based processing
   - Or use Netlify Background Functions

3. **For Now:**
   - The direct approach works for most cases
   - Complex briefs may need to be simplified
   - Or test on the deployed site where async should work better
