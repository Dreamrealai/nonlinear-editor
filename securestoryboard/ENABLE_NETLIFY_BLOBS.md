# How to Enable Netlify Blobs for SecureStoryboard

## Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Through Netlify Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to your Netlify Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://app.netlify.com
   - Select your site: **imagestoryboard**

2. **Enable Blobs**
   - Go to **Site Settings** → **General** → **Site details**
   - Or go to **Site Settings** → **Functions**
   - Look for "Blob storage" or "Netlify Blobs" section
   - If available, enable it

3. **Set Environment Variables** (if needed)
   - Go to **Site Settings** → **Environment variables**
   - Add `NETLIFY_BLOBS_ENABLED=true` (if required)

### 2. Through Netlify CLI

```bash
# In your project directory
cd /Users/davidchen/Desktop/Tech/DreamRealTech/SecureStoryboard/

# Link your site (if not already linked)
netlify link

# Deploy with Blobs enabled
netlify deploy --prod
```

### 3. Verify Setup

After deployment, check your function logs:
- You should no longer see "Failed to get Blobs store" warnings
- Instead, you'll see: "Job [id] saved to Blobs"

## What Netlify Blobs Provides

- **Persistent Storage**: Data survives function restarts
- **10MB per blob**: Plenty for job data
- **Automatic expiration**: Built-in TTL support
- **Edge availability**: Fast access from functions

## Current Status

Your project is already configured for Blobs:
- ✅ `@netlify/blobs` package installed
- ✅ `netlify.toml` configured
- ✅ Code has fallback mechanisms
- ⏳ Just needs to be enabled in Netlify dashboard

## Important Notes

1. **Blobs is a newer Netlify feature** - It might not be available on all plans
2. **The app works fine without it** - The fallback storage is sufficient
3. **No code changes needed** - Everything is already set up in the code

## If Blobs Isn't Available

Don't worry! The system uses these fallbacks automatically:
1. In-memory cache (fast, works great)
2. Environment variables (limited backup)

These are sufficient for all normal operations.

## Testing Blobs Locally

```bash
# Start Netlify Dev
netlify dev

# Blobs will work if your site has it enabled
# Check the console for "Job saved to Blobs" messages
```
