## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: The more detailed your style guide, the better the AI can match your vision

2. **Include Examples**: Describe specific visual examples or references when possible

3. **Prioritize Key Elements**: Start with the most important style elements

4. **Use Consistent Terminology**: Use industry-standard terms for photography and design

5. **Combine with Text Input**: You can upload a file AND type additional style notes in the text field

## Integration with Ad Brief

The visual style elements work in conjunction with your ad brief to create cohesive storyboards:
- The ad brief defines WHAT happens in each scene
- The visual style defines HOW it should look

Both inputs are analyzed together to generate scene prompts that tell your story with your desired visual aesthetic.

## Troubleshooting

### File Not Uploading
- Check file size (must be under 10MB)
- Ensure file extension is supported
- Try converting to PDF or TXT if having issues

### Style Not Being Applied
- Make sure to click "Generate Photos" after uploading
- Check that your style descriptions are clear and specific
- Try adding more detail about visual preferences

### Different Styles Needed for Different Scenes
- Use the chat feature after generation to modify specific scenes
- Example: "Make scene 3 have a more dramatic lighting style"
