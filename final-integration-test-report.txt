A worker process has failed to exit gracefully and has been force exited. This is likely caused by tests leaking due to improper teardown. Try running with --detectOpenHandles to find leaks. Active timers can also cause this, ensure that .unref() was called on them.

Test Suites: 6 failed, 3 passed, 9 total
Tests:       24 failed, 122 passed, 146 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        1.094 s
Ran all test suites matching __tests__/integration.
Force exiting Jest: Have you considered using `--detectOpenHandles` to detect async operations that kept running after all tests finished?
