### Script

**[0:00 - 0:15] Opening**

"Welcome to the Non-Linear Video Editor! I'm excited to show you how easy it is to create professional-quality videos right in your browser. In this tutorial, we'll create your first video project together. Let's get started!"

**[0:15 - 0:45] Interface Overview (30 seconds)**

"Let me give you a quick tour of the editor. At the top, you have the navigation bar with Export, Settings, and Help. On the left is your Asset Panel - this is your media library. The center shows your video preview. And at the bottom is the Timeline - where the magic happens."

**[Visual: Highlight each area as mentioned]**

"Everything is designed to be intuitive. If you've used other video editors, this will feel familiar. If not, don't worry - we'll go through it step by step."

**[0:45 - 1:15] Creating Your First Project (30 seconds)**

"Let's create your first project. Click the 'New Project' button in the top left. Give it a name - I'll call mine 'My First Video'. Click Create."

**[Visual: Show clicking New Project, typing name, clicking Create]**

"And just like that, you have a new project! Notice the project name appears at the top. Your work is automatically saved every 2 seconds, so you never have to worry about losing your progress."

**[1:15 - 1:45] Uploading Assets (30 seconds)**

"Now let's add some media. You can drag files directly from your computer into the Asset Panel, or click the Upload button. I'll drag in a video clip and an audio track."

**[Visual: Drag and drop files into Asset Panel]**

"See the upload progress? Once complete, your assets appear here with thumbnails. You can click on any asset to see its properties - duration, file size, and more."

**[1:45 - 2:15] Adding to Timeline (30 seconds)**

"To start editing, drag an asset from the Asset Panel onto the Timeline. Watch how it snaps into place."

**[Visual: Drag video clip to timeline]**

"That's your first clip on the timeline! You can drag more clips, rearrange them, or add audio tracks underneath. Let me add this music track to the audio section."

**[Visual: Add audio track]**

**[2:15 - 2:45] Preview and Playback (30 seconds)**

"To see what you've created, press the Play button or hit the Spacebar. The playhead moves along the timeline, and you see your video in the preview window."

## Tutorial 2: Timeline Editing Mastery (5 minutes)

**Target Audience**: Users who completed Tutorial 1
**Goal**: Master core editing techniques for professional results
**Key Learning**: Trimming, splitting, selection, grid settings, minimap

### Script

**[0:00 - 0:15] Opening**

"Welcome back! Now that you know the basics, let's dive into timeline editing. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be editing like a pro. We'll cover trimming, splitting, selection tools, grid settings, and the timeline minimap. Let's jump in!"

**[0:15 - 0:50] Trimming Clips (35 seconds)**

"First, let's learn trimming - adjusting where a clip starts and ends. Hover over the edge of a clip. See how the cursor changes? Click and drag to trim. Drag inward to shorten the clip, revealing less of your footage."

**[Visual: Show trim cursor, demonstrate trimming]**

"Trimming is non-destructive - your original file is never modified. You can always extend the clip back if you change your mind. This is perfect for removing unwanted sections at the start or end of clips."

**[Visual: Trim both edges of a clip]**

**[0:50 - 1:25] Splitting Clips (35 seconds)**

"Next up: splitting clips. Say you want to cut a clip into two parts. Position the playhead where you want to split, select the clip, and press 'S' on your keyboard."

**[Visual: Position playhead, press S, show split]**

"Boom! One clip becomes two. You can now delete a section, move parts independently, or insert something in between. This is one of the most powerful editing techniques."

**[Visual: Delete middle section, close gap]**

"Pro tip: Split, then delete unwanted sections. It's faster than precise trimming."

**[1:25 - 2:10] Selection Tools (45 seconds)**

"Selecting clips efficiently saves tons of time. Single click to select one clip. Hold Shift and click another clip to select everything in between."

**[Visual: Demonstrate Shift+Click selection]**

"For non-adjacent clips, click and drag on empty space to draw a selection box. Everything inside gets selected - this is called rubber band selection."

**[Visual: Demonstrate rubber band selection]**

"Want to select all clips on the timeline? Press Cmd+A on Mac or Ctrl+A on Windows. To deselect, just click on empty space."

**[Visual: Show Cmd/Ctrl+A, then deselect]**

**[2:10 - 2:55] Grid Settings & Snap (45 seconds)**

"Grid settings help align clips precisely. Click the grid icon in the toolbar. You'll see preset intervals: 1 second, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, and more."

**[Visual: Open grid settings panel]**

"Choose 5 seconds for general editing. Now enable Snap by clicking the magnet icon, or press Cmd+Shift+S. Watch what happens when I move a clip - it automatically aligns to the grid lines!"

**[Visual: Enable snap, move clip showing snapping behavior]**

"This is incredibly useful for matching clips to music beats or creating consistent timing. Toggle snap on and off as needed - on for rough cuts, off for fine-tuning."

**[2:55 - 3:50] Timeline Minimap (55 seconds)**

"The minimap at the bottom gives you a bird's-eye view of your entire project. Dark blocks represent clips, light areas are gaps."

**[Visual: Point to minimap]**

"See this highlighted box? That's your current viewport - what you see in the timeline. Click and drag it to scroll smoothly through your project."

**[Visual: Drag viewport indicator]**

"Or click anywhere on the minimap to instantly jump to that point. This is super helpful for navigating long projects. You can quickly spot gaps, check pacing, and find specific sections."

**[Visual: Click different areas of minimap, show jumping]**

"The minimap is one of those features you don't know you need until you have it. Trust me, you'll use this constantly!"

**[3:50 - 4:40] Combining Techniques (50 seconds)**

"Let's put it all together. Watch as I edit this rough footage into a polished sequence:"

**[Visual: Show before timeline with rough cuts]**

"First, I'll set my grid to 5 seconds and enable snap. Now I trim the clips to remove unwanted parts. Use rubber band selection to select multiple clips at once. Split here to remove this section... delete... and the gap closes automatically."

**[Visual: Demonstrate workflow]**

"Add transitions by slightly overlapping clips. Use the minimap to check overall pacing. And there you have it - a polished edit!"

**[Visual: Show final result]**

**[4:40 - 5:00] Closing (20 seconds)**

"You've just learned professional editing techniques! Remember: trim to refine, split to remove sections, use selection tools for efficiency, enable snap for alignment, and rely on the minimap for navigation. Next up: Asset Management. See you there!"

## Tutorial 3: Asset Management Made Easy (4 minutes)

**Target Audience**: Users managing multiple assets
**Goal**: Organize assets efficiently for faster workflow
**Key Learning**: Uploading, searching, filtering, tagging, organization strategies

### Script

**[0:00 - 0:15] Opening**

"As your projects grow, managing assets becomes crucial. In this tutorial, you'll learn to upload, organize, search, and filter assets like a pro. Let's keep your media library clean and efficient!"

**[0:15 - 0:45] Uploading Multiple Assets (30 seconds)**

"First, let's talk uploading. You can drag and drop multiple files at once - watch this. I'm selecting 10 files from my computer and dragging them all into the Asset Panel."

**[Visual: Drag multiple files]**

"Each file shows its upload progress. Uploads happen in parallel, so this is fast. Continue editing while uploads happen in the background - no waiting!"

**[Visual: Show progress bars, continue working]**

**[0:45 - 1:25] Searching Assets (40 seconds)**

"With dozens or hundreds of assets, searching is essential. Click the search box and type part of a file name. Results filter in real-time."

**[Visual: Type in search box, show filtering]**

"Search looks through file names and tags. Use specific keywords for better results. For exact phrases, use quotation marks like this: 'take 2'."

**[Visual: Demonstrate exact phrase search]**

"Clear the search to see all assets again. Simple, but powerful."

**[1:25 - 2:05] Filtering Assets (40 seconds)**

"Filters help you see specific types of assets. Click the Filter dropdown. You can filter by type: Videos, Audio, Images."

**[Visual: Open filter dropdown, select Videos]**

"Only videos are shown now. Combine with search for even more precision - let's search for 'interview' while filtering Videos."

**[Visual: Combine filter and search]**

"You can also filter by usage - see which assets are on your timeline, and which are unused. Super helpful for cleaning up your library!"

**[Visual: Show usage filter options]**

**[2:05 - 2:45] Tagging for Organization (40 seconds)**

"Tags are your secret weapon for organization. Right-click any asset and select 'Edit Tags'. Type a tag name - I'll add 'B-roll' - and press Enter."

**[Visual: Right-click, edit tags, add tag]**

"Add multiple tags: 'outdoor', 'daytime', 'nature'. Now this asset is super easy to find later. You can bulk tag multiple assets too - select several, right-click, and add tags to all at once."

**[Visual: Demonstrate bulk tagging]**

"Create a tag system before you start: tag by scene, type, quality, location. Your future self will thank you!"

**[2:45 - 3:25] Sorting and Organizing (40 seconds)**

"The Sort dropdown changes how assets are ordered. Sort by name alphabetically, by date added, by file size, or by duration."

**[Visual: Show sort options]**

"Want to find large files to delete? Sort by file size, largest first. Need to see recent uploads? Sort by date added, newest first."

**[Visual: Demonstrate different sort orders]**

"Combine search, filters, tags, and sorting to find exactly what you need. For example: Videos, tagged 'Interview', sorted by date. Perfect!"

**[3:25 - 3:50] Best Practices (25 seconds)**

"Here are my top tips: Name files descriptively before uploading. Tag assets as you upload them - don't let untagged assets pile up. Delete unused assets regularly to save storage. And use collections to group related assets by project."

**[Visual: Show examples of good vs. bad practices]**

**[3:50 - 4:00] Closing (10 seconds)**

"With these asset management skills, you'll work faster and stay organized even on large projects. Next up: Advanced Features and Power User Tips. See you there!"

## Tutorial 4: Advanced Features & Power User Tips (6 minutes)

**Target Audience**: Experienced users ready for advanced techniques
**Goal**: Master efficiency tricks, shortcuts, and hidden features
**Key Learning**: Keyboard shortcuts, advanced workflows, tips & tricks, Easter eggs

### Script

**[0:00 - 0:15] Opening**

"Ready to become a power user? This tutorial reveals advanced features, efficiency tricks, and hidden gems that will supercharge your editing workflow. Let's unlock the full potential of this editor!"

**[0:15 - 1:00] Keyboard Shortcut Mastery (45 seconds)**

"Keyboard shortcuts are the difference between beginner and pro. Press Cmd+? or Ctrl+? to see all available shortcuts."

**[Visual: Open keyboard shortcuts modal]**

"The essentials: Space for play/pause, S to split, Delete to remove clips, Cmd/Ctrl+Z for undo. But here are the game-changers: Cmd/Ctrl+D duplicates selected clips instantly. Bracket keys [ and ] trim to playhead. Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+S toggles snap."

**[Visual: Demonstrate each shortcut with on-screen overlay]**

"Learn five shortcuts at a time. Use them for a day until they're muscle memory, then learn five more. In a week, you'll be flying through edits!"

**[1:00 - 2:00] Advanced Selection Techniques (60 seconds)**

"Selection mastery speeds up editing dramatically. You already know Shift+Click for ranges and rubber band selection. Here's the next level."

**[Visual: Demonstrate as explained]**

"Cmd/Ctrl+Click to add individual clips to your selection without selecting everything in between. Select all clips in a track by right-clicking the track header."

**[Visual: Show track header context menu]**

"Here's a pro move: Select clips, copy with Cmd/Ctrl+C, move the playhead, paste with Cmd/Ctrl+V. Instant duplication at a specific point!"

**[Visual: Demonstrate copy-paste workflow]**

"And this trick: Use Cmd/Ctrl+D to duplicate, then immediately drag. It's faster than copy-paste for multiple duplications."

**[2:00 - 3:00] Timeline Navigation Secrets (60 seconds)**

"Navigate your timeline like a pro. Home key jumps to start, End key to the end. Left and right arrows move one frame - perfect for precision."

**[Visual: Show keyboard navigation]**

"But add Shift: Shift+Left/Right jumps by one second. Combine with Cmd/Ctrl to jump by markers."

**[Visual: Demonstrate]**

"Use markers liberally - press M to add one at the playhead. Mark beat drops, scene changes, or review points. Then use Shift+M to jump between markers."

**[Visual: Add markers, jump between them]**

"Zoom shortcuts: Cmd/Ctrl + equals to zoom in, Cmd/Ctrl + minus to zoom out, Cmd/Ctrl + 0 to fit entire timeline. These shortcuts become second nature!"

**[3:00 - 4:00] Workflow Optimization (60 seconds)**

"Let me show you my real-world workflow for a typical video:"

**[Visual: Screen recording of actual editing session]**

"Stage 1: Rough cut. I get all clips on the timeline, don't worry about perfection. Use 10-second grid interval for speed."

"Stage 2: Fine cut. Switch to 1-second grid. Trim clips precisely, remove gaps, refine pacing. Use minimap to check overall flow."

"Stage 3: Polish. Add text overlays, adjust audio levels, and use the undo history liberally to experiment."

**[Visual: Show each stage]**

"This three-stage approach keeps me organized and prevents getting bogged down in details too early. Try it on your next project!"

**[4:00 - 4:45] Advanced Timeline Features (45 seconds)**

"Some hidden gems: Right-click on clips for the context menu - duplicate, split, delete, and more."

**[Visual: Show context menu]**

"The timeline ruler shows time markers. Right-click it to change time display: timecode, frames, or seconds."

**[Visual: Right-click ruler, change display]**

"Enable Edit Mode Feedback in settings to see visual indicators when performing actions. And use the timeline guides feature to align clips across tracks."

**[Visual: Show guides feature]**

**[4:45 - 5:30] Easter Eggs and Hidden Features (45 seconds)**

"Now for the fun part - Easter eggs! Try typing the Konami Code: Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A. Something special happens..."

**[Visual: Type Konami code, show Easter egg]**

"There are several hidden features. Press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+D to toggle debug mode and see performance metrics. Add '?debug=true' to the URL for advanced logging."

**[Visual: Show debug mode]**

"And here's a secret: Triple-click a clip to select all clips in that track. Try it!"

**[Visual: Demonstrate triple-click]**

**[5:30 - 6:00] Closing (30 seconds)**

"You're now armed with advanced techniques that separate pros from beginners! Remember: master keyboard shortcuts, work in stages, use the right tools at the right time, and don't be afraid to experiment."
