## Issues Fixed

### 1. Memory Leaks from Polling Operations ✓

**Severity:** Critical
**Impact:** Browser crashes, performance degradation
**Files Modified:**

- `app/video-gen/page.tsx`
- `app/audio-gen/page.tsx`
- `app/editor/[projectId]/BrowserEditorClient.tsx`

**What Was Wrong:**

- Uncancelled `setTimeout` loops running indefinitely
- No cleanup on component unmount
- State updates after component unmounted
- No maximum attempt limits

**What Was Fixed:**

```typescript
// Added cleanup tracking
const pollingTimeoutRef = useRef<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null);
const isMountedRef = useRef(true);
const pollingAttemptsRef = useRef(0);

// Cleanup on unmount
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    isMountedRef.current = false;
    if (pollingTimeoutRef.current) {
      clearTimeout(pollingTimeoutRef.current);
    }
  };
}, []);

// Check mounted status before state updates
if (!isMountedRef.current) return;

// Max attempts limit
if (pollingAttemptsRef.current > MAX_POLLING_ATTEMPTS) {
  toast.error('Operation timed out after 10 minutes');
  return;
}
```

**Benefits:**

- No more memory leaks when navigating away during generation
- Prevents browser crashes from infinite polling
- Proper timeout messages instead of silent failures
- Clean component unmount without errors

---

### 2. Missing Admin Audit Log Table ✓

**Severity:** Critical
**Impact:** Compliance violations, no audit trail
**Files Created:**

- `supabase/migrations/20251023200000_add_admin_audit_log.sql`

**What Was Wrong:**

- Code referenced `admin_audit_log` table that didn't exist
- Admin actions had no audit trail
- GDPR compliance issues

**What Was Fixed:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE admin_audit_log (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  admin_user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  action TEXT NOT NULL,
  target_user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  target_resource_type TEXT,
  target_resource_id TEXT,
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
  ip_address TEXT,
  user_agent TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- RLS policies restricting access to admins only
-- Indexes for efficient queries
-- Immutable (no UPDATE/DELETE policies)
```

**Benefits:**

- Complete audit trail for all admin actions
- GDPR compliance for data access tracking
- Indexed for fast queries
- Immutable for compliance requirements

---

### 3. Incomplete Account Deletion ✓

**Severity:** Critical
**Impact:** GDPR compliance violations, poor UX
**Files Modified:**

- `app/settings/page.tsx`

**Files Created:**

- `app/api/user/delete-account/route.ts`

**What Was Wrong:**

- Delete button didn't actually delete accounts
- Client-side code couldn't delete auth users
- Only deleted projects, left orphaned data
- Error message told users to "contact support"

**What Was Fixed:**

```typescript
// New API endpoint using service role client
export async function DELETE(_req: NextRequest) {
  const adminClient = createClient(supabaseUrl, serviceRoleKey);

  // Delete projects (cascades to assets, clips, frames)
  await adminClient.from('projects').delete().eq('user_id', userId);

  // Delete subscriptions
  await adminClient.from('user_subscriptions').delete().eq('user_id', userId);

  // Delete activity history
  await adminClient.from('user_activity_history').delete().eq('user_id', userId);

  // Delete storage files
  await adminClient.storage.from('assets').remove(assetPaths);
  await adminClient.storage.from('frames').remove(framePaths);

  // Delete auth user (requires service role)
  await adminClient.auth.admin.deleteUser(userId);
}
```

**Benefits:**

- GDPR "right to be forgotten" compliance
- Complete data deletion (projects, storage, auth)
- Proper user experience with success messages
- Automatic redirect after deletion

---

### 4. Authorization Vulnerability in Frame Edit ✓

**Severity:** Critical
**Impact:** Users could edit other users' frames
**Files Modified:**

- `app/api/frames/[frameId]/edit/route.ts`

**What Was Wrong:**

- Only checked project ownership
- Didn't verify user owned the frame itself
- Didn't verify user owned the source asset

**What Was Fixed:**

```typescript
// Single query with joined ownership checks
const { data: frame } = await supabase
  .from('scene_frames')
  .select(
    `
    *,
    project:projects!inner(id, user_id),
    asset:assets!inner(id, user_id)
  `
  )
  .eq('id', frameId)
  .single();

// Verify user owns project
if (!frame.project || frame.project.user_id !== user.id) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    {
      error: 'Unauthorized - you do not own this project',
    },
    { status: 403 }
  );
}

// Verify user owns asset
if (!frame.asset || frame.asset.user_id !== user.id) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    {
      error: 'Unauthorized - you do not own this asset',
    },
    { status: 403 }
  );
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Closed authorization bypass vulnerability
- Efficient single-query ownership verification
- Clear error messages for debugging
- Defense in depth security

---

### 5. Resource Cleanup Failures ✓

**Severity:** Critical
**Impact:** Orphaned storage objects, quota exhaustion
**Files Modified:**

- `app/api/video/status/route.ts`
- `app/api/video/upscale-status/route.ts`

**What Was Wrong:**

- Storage cleanup errors logged but not handled
- Failed cleanups didn't return error responses
- Orphaned files accumulated over time

**What Was Fixed:**

```typescript
if (assetError) {
  // Clean up uploaded file
  const { error: cleanupError } = await supabase.storage.from('assets').remove([storagePath]);

  if (cleanupError) {
    console.error('Failed to clean up storage:', cleanupError);
    // Return error with cleanup context
    throw new Error(
      `Asset creation failed: ${assetError.message}. ` +
        `Additionally, failed to clean up storage: ${cleanupError.message}`
    );
  }

  throw new Error(`Asset creation failed: ${assetError.message}`);
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Prevents storage quota exhaustion
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Proper error propagation to clients
- Clean failure recovery

---

### 6. Memory Leak in Chat Attachments ✓

**Severity:** Critical
**Impact:** Memory leaks with large file attachments
**Files Modified:**

- `components/editor/ChatBox.tsx`

**What Was Wrong:**

- Blob URLs created with `URL.createObjectURL()`
- URLs never revoked with `URL.revokeObjectURL()`
- Memory leaked on every attachment send
- Memory leaked when attachments removed

**What Was Fixed:**

```typescript
// Track blob URLs for cleanup
const attachmentBlobUrlsRef = useRef<Map<File, string>>(new Map());

// Cleanup on unmount
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    attachmentBlobUrlsRef.current.forEach((url) => {
      URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
    });
    attachmentBlobUrlsRef.current.clear();
  };
}, []);

// Revoke when attachment removed
const removeAttachment = (index: number) => {
  setAttachments((prev) => {
    const fileToRemove = prev[index];
    const url = attachmentBlobUrlsRef.current.get(fileToRemove);
    if (url) {
      URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
      attachmentBlobUrlsRef.current.delete(fileToRemove);
    }
    return prev.filter((_, i) => i !== index);
  });
};
```

**Benefits:**

- No memory leaks from large file attachments
- Proper cleanup on component unmount
- Better performance with multiple attachments
- Prevents browser slowdown over time

---

### 7. Duplicate Upload Logic ✓

**Severity:** Critical
**Impact:** Maintenance burden, inconsistent behavior
**Files Modified:**

- `app/editor/[projectId]/BrowserEditorClient.tsx`

**What Was Wrong:**

- Entire upload logic duplicated in client and server
- ~75 lines of duplicate code
- Inconsistent validation and error handling
- Two places to maintain same logic

**What Was Fixed:**

```typescript
// Before: ~75 lines of duplicate upload code
// After: Simple API call
async function uploadAsset({ file, projectId, assetType }: UploadAssetArgs) {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', file);
  formData.append('projectId', projectId);
  formData.append('type', assetType);

  const response = await fetch('/api/assets/upload', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData,
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    const errorData = await response.json();
    throw new Error(errorData.error || 'Upload failed');
  }

  const result = await response.json();

  // Fetch complete asset record
  const { data: assetData } = await supabase
    .from('assets')
    .select('*')
    .eq('id', result.assetId)
    .single();

  return assetData;
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Single source of truth for upload logic
- Reduced code duplication by ~75 lines
- Consistent validation across all uploads
- Easier to maintain and update
- Better security (server-side validation)
