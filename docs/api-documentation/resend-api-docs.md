## Introduction

### Base URL

The Resend API is built on **REST** principles and enforces **HTTPS** in every request to improve data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support **HTTP**.

```
https://api.resend.com
```

### Response Codes

Resend uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of requests:

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `200` | Successful request |
| `400` | Check that the parameters were correct |
| `401` | The API key used was missing |
| `403` | The API key used was invalid |
| `404` | The resource was not found |
| `429` | The rate limit was exceeded |
| `5xx` | Indicates an error with Resend servers |

### API Versioning

Currently, there is no versioning system in place. Resend plans to add versioning via calendar-based headers in the future.

---

## Authentication

To authenticate, you need to add an `Authorization` header with a Bearer token containing your API Key.

### Header Format

```
Authorization: Bearer re_xxxxxxxxx
```

### Obtaining API Keys

API keys can be generated from the [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/api-keys).

### API Key Types

- **Full Access**: Can perform all API operations including sending emails and managing resources
- **Sending Access**: Restricted to only sending emails

### Security Notes

- Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code
- Use environment variables to store API keys
- Rotate API keys regularly for security
- Use sending-access keys when only email sending is required

---

## Rate Limits

### Default Rate Limit

The default maximum rate limit is **2 requests per second**. This can be increased for trusted senders by request.

### Rate Limit Headers

Every API response includes rate limit information in the headers (conforming to [IETF standard draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers-06)):

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ratelimit-limit` | Maximum number of requests allowed within a window |
| `ratelimit-remaining` | Requests remaining in the current window |
| `ratelimit-reset` | Seconds until the limits are reset |
| `retry-after` | Seconds to wait before making a follow-up request |

### Handling Rate Limits

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429` response error code.

**Best practices:**
- Implement a queue mechanism to manage request flow
- Reduce the number of concurrent requests per second
- Use exponential backoff for retries
- Monitor rate limit headers to adjust request patterns
- Contact support to request rate increases if needed

### Checking Rate Limit Violations

You can find all 429 responses by filtering for status code 429 in the [Resend Logs page](https://resend.com/logs?status=429).

## Domain Verification

### Overview

Resend sends emails using a domain you own. Domain verification is required to send emails to addresses beyond your own.

### Subdomain Recommendation

It's recommended to use subdomains (e.g., `updates.yourdomain.com`) to:
- Isolate your sending reputation
- Clearly communicate intent
- Protect your root domain reputation

### Required DNS Records

To verify a domain, you must set two DNS entries:

#### 1. SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
- **Type:** TXT record
- **Purpose:** Lists IP addresses authorized to send email on behalf of your domain
- **Additional:** MX record for bounce and complaint feedback

#### 2. DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
- **Type:** TXT record
- **Purpose:** Public key used to verify email authenticity

### Domain Verification Process

1. Add your domain in the [Resend Domains Dashboard](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Add the provided SPF and DKIM records to your DNS
3. Click "Verify DNS Records" in the dashboard
4. Wait for verification (usually a few minutes, up to 72 hours)

### Domain Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `not_started` | Domain added but verification not initiated |
| `pending` | Resend is verifying the domain |
| `verified` | Domain successfully verified for sending |
| `failed` | Unable to detect DNS records within 72 hours |
| `temporary_failure` | Previously verified domain no longer detectable. Resend will recheck for 72 hours. |

### Custom Return Path

By default, Resend uses the `send` subdomain for the Return-Path address. You can customize this:

**Via API:**
```javascript
resend.domains.create({
  name: 'example.com',
  customReturnPath: 'outbound'
});
```

**Custom Return Path Rules:**
- Max 63 characters
- Must start with a letter
- Must end with a letter or number
- Can contain only letters, numbers, and hyphens
- Avoid values that undermine credibility (e.g., "testing")

### SPF Record Details

SPF configuration includes:
- TXT record listing approved IP addresses
- MX record for recipient bounce/complaint feedback

### DKIM Record Details

DKIM configuration includes:
- TXT record with public key for email authenticity verification

### Optional: DMARC Record

After SPF and DKIM verify, you can optionally add a DMARC record to build additional trust with mailbox providers.

### Open and Click Tracking

Open and click tracking is **disabled by default** for all domains. You can enable it in domain settings.

#### How Open Tracking Works
- 1x1 pixel transparent GIF inserted in each email
- Unique reference tracks when image is downloaded
- Identifies which message was opened and by whom

#### How Click Tracking Works
- Modifies each link in HTML email
- Recipients are sent to Resend server first
- Immediately redirected to URL destination
- Tracks click events

**Important:** For best deliverability, disable click and open tracking for sensitive transactional emails.

### Domain Requirements

- You must own the domain (not shared or public domains)
- DNS access is required for verification
- Proper DNS configuration is essential

---

## Webhooks

### Overview

Resend uses webhooks to push real-time notifications about email sending events via HTTPS POST requests with JSON payloads.

### Use Cases

- Automatically remove bounced email addresses from mailing lists
- Create alerts in messaging or incident tools based on event types
- Store all send events in your database for custom reporting/retention

### Setup Steps

#### 1. Create Local Endpoint

Create a route that accepts POST requests:

```typescript
// Example: pages/api/webhooks.ts (Next.js)
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

export default (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
  if (req.method === 'POST') {
    const payload = req.body;
    console.log(payload);
    res.status(200).send('OK');
  }
};
```

**Important:** Always respond with `HTTP 200 OK` to signal successful delivery.

#### 2. Register Development Webhook

For development, create a public tunnel to your localhost:
- Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download)
- Use [VS Code Port Forwarding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/port-forwarding)

Example URL: `https://example123.ngrok.io/api/webhook`

Register the URL in the [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/webhooks).

#### 3. Test Webhook

Send test emails to verify your webhook endpoint is receiving events. Check the webhook events list in the dashboard.

#### 4. Deploy to Production

Deploy your webhook endpoint to your production environment.

#### 5. Register Production Webhook

Register your production webhook URL in the Resend dashboard.

### Webhook Retry Schedule

If Resend does not receive a 200 response, webhooks are retried on this schedule:

1. 5 seconds
2. 5 minutes
3. 30 minutes
4. 2 hours
5. 5 hours
6. 10 hours

After all retries fail, the message is marked as failed and you receive a `message.attempt.exhausted` webhook.

### Webhook IP Addresses

Webhooks POST from these IP addresses (for allowlist configuration):

- `44.228.126.217`
- `50.112.21.217`
- `52.24.126.164`
- `54.148.139.208`
- `2600:1f24:64:8000::/52`

### Manual Retry

You can manually retry webhook events from the dashboard:
1. View webhook details
2. Click the event you want to retry
3. View payload and click the replay button

### Webhook Security

- Use HTTPS endpoints only
- Verify webhook signatures (if implemented)
- Validate payload structure before processing
- Implement idempotent event handling
- Log all webhook events for debugging

### Example Webhook Code

See [webhook code example](https://github.com/resend/resend-examples/tree/main/with-webhooks) for implementation guidance.

## Best Practices

### Authentication
- Store API keys in environment variables
- Never expose API keys in client-side code
