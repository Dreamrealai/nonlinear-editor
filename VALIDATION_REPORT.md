## HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES (16)

### ISSUE #5: HIGH-002 - No Timeline Virtualization

**STATUS:** RESOLVED
**EVIDENCE:**

- Virtualization implemented via `VirtualizedClipRenderer.tsx` (exists at `/Users/davidchen/Projects/non-linear-editor/components/VirtualizedClipRenderer.tsx`)
- `HorizontalTimeline.tsx` line 8: `import { useTimelineScroll } from './VirtualizedClipRenderer'`
- Lines 275-276: "Track scroll position for virtualized rendering (10-100x fewer DOM nodes for large projects)"
- Lines 380-395: Implements viewport-based clip filtering with 500px overscan buffer
- Only renders clips visible in viewport plus overscan, dramatically improving performance
- Comments indicate "prevents rendering 1000+ clips at once"

**SEVERITY:** No longer high - Virtualization fully implemented

---

### ISSUE #6: HIGH-003 - Mouse Move Handler Performance (60+ updates/second)

**STATUS:** CONFIRMED
**EVIDENCE:**

- `HorizontalTimeline.tsx` lines 407-489: `handleMouseMove` callback directly updates state on every mousemove event
- No throttling or debouncing detected
- Lines 493-500: Event listener added without rate limiting
- Mouse move handler updates clip positions, playhead, and trimming in real-time
- Code inspection shows no RAF batching or throttle mechanism
- **60+ updates per second during drag operations**

**SEVERITY:** HIGH (unchanged)

---

### ISSUE #7: HIGH-004 - No Database Query Caching

**STATUS:** CONFIRMED
**EVIDENCE:**

- `app/page.tsx` lines 30-35: Direct Supabase query with `.from('projects')` - no caching
- No `revalidate` or cache configuration found
- Line 5: `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` - explicitly disables caching
- Every page load executes fresh database queries
- **No query result caching, no Redis, no in-memory cache**

**SEVERITY:** HIGH (unchanged)

---

### ISSUE #8: HIGH-006 - RAF Loop Without Throttling

**STATUS:** RESOLVED
**EVIDENCE:**

- `PreviewPlayer.tsx` lines 639-649: Implements throttling
- Line 644: "Throttle sync during playback to every 16ms (60fps max)"
- Lines 645-648: Checks `performance.now()` against `lastSyncTimeRef` with 16ms threshold
- RAF loop at lines 749-752 is throttled to 60fps
- Proper cleanup and throttling mechanism in place

**SEVERITY:** No longer high - Throttling implemented

---

### ISSUE #9: HIGH-007 - No Video Element Pooling

**STATUS:** RESOLVED
**EVIDENCE:**

- `PreviewPlayer.tsx` line 339: `const videoPoolRef = useRef<HTMLVideoElement[]>([]);`
- Line 340: `const VIDEO_POOL_MAX_SIZE = 10;`
- Lines 335-338: Extensive documentation of pooling strategy
- Line 480: `const video = videoPoolRef.current.pop() ?? document.createElement('video');`

- **Object pooling fully implemented with max 10 reusable elements**

**SEVERITY:** No longer high - Video element pooling implemented

---

### ISSUE #10: HIGH-009 - Unhandled Promise Rejections

**STATUS:** PARTIALLY RESOLVED
**EVIDENCE:**

- `PreviewPlayer.tsx` has try-catch blocks at critical points (lines 430, 782)
- `.catch()` handlers on promises at lines 697, 719, 926
- **However:** Lines 420, 434, 439, 459, 476 still throw errors that could propagate as unhandled rejections
- Error tracking via `browserLogger.error` exists but doesn't prevent rejection propagation
- Some promise chains lack proper error boundaries

**SEVERITY:** MEDIUM (downgraded from HIGH - partial improvement)

---

### ISSUE #11: HIGH-010 - Potential Null Pointer Dereference

**STATUS:** RESOLVED
**EVIDENCE:**

- `HorizontalTimeline.tsx` uses optional chaining throughout (6 instances of `?.` operator)
- Line 29: Safe array access via `safeArrayLast(segments)` utility
- Lines 420-449: Extensive null/undefined checks before clip operations
- Null checks: `if (!clip) return;`, `if (!containerRef.current || !timeline) return;`
- **Proper defensive programming with null guards**

**SEVERITY:** No longer high - Null safety improved

---

### ISSUE #12: HIGH-011 - Missing Error Boundaries

**STATUS:** PARTIALLY RESOLVED
**EVIDENCE:**

- `ErrorBoundary.tsx` component exists (50+ lines) with proper implementation
- `app/layout.tsx` wraps app in ErrorBoundary (lines 35-39)
- **However:** Only 1 of 19 pages/layouts use ErrorBoundary (root layout only)
- Individual routes, editor pages, and complex components lack error boundaries
- No error boundaries around PreviewPlayer, HorizontalTimeline, or other critical components

**SEVERITY:** MEDIUM (downgraded from HIGH - partial coverage)

---

### ISSUE #13: HIGH-013 - Large Components

**STATUS:** CONFIRMED
**EVIDENCE:**
Line counts measured:

- `PreviewPlayer.tsx`: **1,071 lines** (originally reported as 39,399 - dramatic improvement)
- `HorizontalTimeline.tsx`: **1,014 lines** (originally reported as 42,424 - dramatic improvement)
- `BrowserEditorClient.tsx`: **2,251 lines** (still massive)
- `ChatBox.tsx`: **488 lines** (reasonable size)

**SEVERITY:** MEDIUM (downgraded from HIGH - significant improvement on 2 of 3 files)

---

### ISSUE #14: HIGH-014 - Tight Coupling to Database

**STATUS:** PARTIALLY RESOLVED
**EVIDENCE:**

- Service layer exists: `lib/services/projectService.ts` (269 lines), `lib/services/assetService.ts` (302 lines)
- **However:** 33 files in `app/` directory still use direct `.from()` queries
- Pages with direct database access: 7+ page.tsx files query Supabase directly
- `app/page.tsx` lines 30-35, 44-45: Direct database queries without service layer
- **50+ direct database queries** found across app directory
- Service layer exists but is not consistently used

**SEVERITY:** HIGH (unchanged - service layer underutilized)

---

### ISSUE #15: HIGH-015 - God Object Pattern (useEditorStore.ts)

**STATUS:** RESOLVED
**EVIDENCE:**

- `useEditorStore.ts`: **613 lines** (originally reported as 20,775 lines - massive improvement)
- Well-documented with clear responsibilities (lines 1-20)
- Proper separation of concerns: timeline, playback, selection, undo/redo
- Immer middleware for immutable updates
- Debounced history saves (lines 34-50)
- **Reasonable size and well-structured**

**SEVERITY:** No longer high - Store significantly refactored

---

### ISSUE #16: HIGH-016 - No Service Layer Architecture

**STATUS:** PARTIALLY RESOLVED
**EVIDENCE:**

- Service layer **exists**: 2 service files totaling 571 lines
- `lib/services/projectService.ts`: Handles projects CRUD, ownership verification
- `lib/services/assetService.ts`: Handles assets operations
- **Problem:** Service layer not consistently used throughout app
- Many components/routes still bypass service layer for direct database access
- Architecture exists but adoption is incomplete (~30% coverage)

**SEVERITY:** MEDIUM (downgraded from HIGH - foundation in place, needs adoption)

---

### ISSUE #17: HIGH-017 - Build Script Issues

**STATUS:** RESOLVED
**EVIDENCE:**

- `package.json` line 7: `"build": "next build"` (clean, no --turbopack flag)
- `dev` script uses `--turbopack` (line 6) but build does not
- Build script follows Next.js best practices
- Separate scripts for dev and production builds

**SEVERITY:** No longer high - Build script corrected

---

### ISSUE #18: HIGH-018-021 - Missing Dev Tools

**STATUS:** PARTIALLY RESOLVED
**EVIDENCE:**

- ✅ **Prettier:** `.prettierrc` exists with comprehensive config (13 lines)
- ❌ **Pre-commit hooks:** No `.husky/` directory exists in project root
- ❌ **Node engine specification:** No `engines` field in package.json
- 1 of 3 dev tools implemented

**SEVERITY:** MEDIUM (downgraded from HIGH - partial implementation)

---

### ISSUE #19: MED-002 - No Pagination for Assets/Projects

**STATUS:** CONFIRMED
**EVIDENCE:**

- `app/page.tsx` line 35: `.limit(1)` - only for single project fetch
- `AssetPanel.tsx`: No pagination, limit, or offset parameters found
- Components fetch all assets/projects without pagination
- Large asset libraries would cause performance issues

**SEVERITY:** MEDIUM (unchanged)

---

### ISSUE #20: MED-007-008 - Memory Leaks

**STATUS:** RESOLVED
**EVIDENCE:**

**ChatBox Memory Leak:**

- `ChatBox.tsx` lines 44-61: Blob URL tracking and cleanup implemented
- Line 44: "CRITICAL FIX: Track blob URLs for cleanup to prevent memory leaks"
- Lines 49-61: `useEffect` cleanup revokes all blob URLs on unmount
- **Fixed**

**Thumbnail Generation Memory Leak:**

- `GenerateVideoTab.tsx` line 140: `URL.createObjectURL(file)`
- Line 77: `URL.revokeObjectURL(imagePreviewUrl)` - proper cleanup
- `handleClearImage` callback (lines 73-83) revokes blob URLs
- **Fixed**
