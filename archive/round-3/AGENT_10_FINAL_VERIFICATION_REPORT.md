## Critical Issues Remaining

### üö® Priority 0: Blockers (Must Fix Immediately)

#### 1. Merge Conflicts in Source Code

**Location:** `lib/webhooks.ts`
**Impact:** 7 unit tests failing, prevents compilation
**Effort:** 15 minutes
**Fix:** Manual resolution of merge conflict markers

**Action Required:**

```bash
# Open file and resolve conflicts
code lib/webhooks.ts
# Look for <<<<<<, ======, >>>>>> markers
# Choose correct code path
# Remove markers
# Test and commit
```

---

### üî• Priority 1: High Impact, Low Effort (This Week)

#### 2. Web Vitals Mock Integration

**Status:** ‚úÖ Mock created, needs verification
**Impact:** 30-40 tests currently failing
**Effort:** 30 minutes (verification + any tweaks)
**Expected Gain:** +0.9% pass rate

**Current Issue:** Mock exists but tests still failing with web-vitals errors

**Action Required:**

- Verify mock is being loaded correctly
- Check jest.config.js mock configuration
- Ensure web-vitals imports resolve to mock

#### 3. BrowserLogger Window Redefinition

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially fixed, still has errors
**Impact:** 5 tests failing
**Effort:** 2 hours
**Expected Gain:** +0.1% pass rate

**Current Error:**

```
TypeError: Cannot redefine property: window
    at Function.defineProperty (<anonymous>)
```

**Action Required:**

- Use alternative approach (delete + reassign)
- Or use jest.replaceProperty() if available
- Update test file to avoid global.window conflicts

#### 4. WebVitals Component Test

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Test exists but failing
**Impact:** 1 test failing
**Effort:** 30 minutes
**Expected Gain:** +0.02% pass rate

**Current Error:**

```
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'mockInitWebVitals' before initialization
```

**Action Required:**

- Move mock definition before jest.mock() call
- Use jest.fn() directly in mock factory
- Ensure proper hoisting

**Week 1 Expected Result:** 72.5% ‚Üí 73.5% pass rate (if all fixed)

---

### üìä Priority 2: Medium Impact, Medium Effort (2 Weeks)

#### 5. Apply API Route Fix Pattern (Bulk Operation)

**Impact:** 32 failing API route tests
**Effort:** 8-10 hours
**Expected Gain:** +1.0-1.2% pass rate

**Pattern Created by Agent 8:**

- Use `createMockRequest()` for request setup
- Use `mockAuthenticatedUser()` for auth context
- Use `createMockSupabaseClient()` for database mocking
- Standardize error assertions

**Files to Fix:** 32 API route test files

**Approach:**

1. Create script to identify common patterns
2. Apply helper functions systematically
3. Test after each file or batch
4. Commit incrementally

#### 6. Apply Component Fix Pattern (Bulk Operation)

**Impact:** 50+ failing component tests
**Effort:** 6-8 hours
**Expected Gain:** +1.2-1.5% pass rate

**Pattern Identified by Agent 9:**

```typescript
// When component uses named export
export function MyComponent() { ... }

// Mock must use named export
jest.mock('@/components/MyComponent', () => ({
  MyComponent: jest.fn(() => <div>Mock</div>),
}));
```

**Files to Fix:** 30+ component test files

**Approach:**

1. Audit all component exports (named vs default)
2. Update mocks to match export style
3. Test each batch of 5-10 files
4. Update documentation with patterns

#### 7. Fix Remaining Integration Tests

**Impact:** 38 integration tests failing
**Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Expected Gain:** +0.9% pass rate (to reach 90%+)

**Common Issues:**

- Mock chain issues (nested promises)
- Test expectations mismatched
- Timing issues (async/await)
- Missing error handlers

**Approach:**

1. Categorize failures by type
2. Fix mock chains (most common)
3. Update test expectations
4. Add proper async handling

**Week 2 Expected Result:** 73.5% ‚Üí 77-78% pass rate

---

### üéØ Priority 3: Long-term Improvements (1-2 Months)

#### 8. Increase Test Coverage to 70%

**Current:** 30.22%
**Target:** 70%
**Gap:** -39.78%
**Effort:** 40-60 hours

**Focus Areas:**

- API routes: 13.75% ‚Üí 70% (+56.25%)
- Components: 21.04% ‚Üí 70% (+48.96%)
- Hooks: Coverage varies widely
- Services: Good coverage, maintain

**Approach:**

1. Write tests for 26 untested API routes (12 hours)
2. Add component tests for uncovered components (20 hours)
3. Add integration tests for user flows (15 hours)
4. Add edge case tests (10 hours)

#### 9. Memory Optimization

**Current Issue:** Jest workers running out of memory
**Impact:** 2 test suites crashing
**Effort:** 2-4 hours

**Current Error:**

```
Jest worker ran out of memory and crashed
```

**Action Required:**

- Increase worker memory limit (currently 1GB)
- Reduce concurrent workers (currently 3)
- Identify memory-intensive tests
- Add cleanup in afterEach/afterAll

#### 10. Snapshot Updates

**Current:** 2 snapshots failed
**Impact:** 2 tests failing
**Effort:** 30 minutes

**Action Required:**

```bash
npm test -- -u  # Update snapshots
git diff  # Review changes
git add . && git commit  # Commit if correct
```

## Build Status

### Current Build

**Status:** üü° IN PROGRESS / FAILING (as of report generation)

**Previous Build Errors:**

1. **TransitionPanel.tsx Line 66:**

   ```
   Type error: Cannot find name 'Timeline'
   ```

   - Timeline type exists and is exported from `/types/timeline.ts`
   - Import statement is correct
   - Likely a build cache issue
   - **Fix:** Clear .next cache or check for circular dependencies

2. **share-links/[linkId]/route.ts Line 152:**
   ```
   Type error: Argument of type '{ readonly max: 10; readonly windowMs: number; }'
   is not assignable to parameter of type 'AuthOptions'
   ```

   - Code inspection shows proper options object structure
   - May be resolved in current version
   - **Fix:** Verify type definitions for withAuth

**Recommendation:**

- Clear build cache: `rm -rf .next && npm run build`
- If errors persist, check for type definition updates needed
- TypeScript compilation succeeds for test files (verified by Agent 10)
