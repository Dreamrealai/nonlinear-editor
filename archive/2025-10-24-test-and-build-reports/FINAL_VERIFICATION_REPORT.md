4. **Comprehensive test infrastructure** established

### ❌ Gaps

1. **Test suite instability** - memory crashes, process exceptions
2. **Coverage target missed** - 46.65% vs 70% goal (-23.35%)
3. **Mock configuration issues** - window, AudioContext, globals
4. **Pass rate target missed** - 76.8% vs 95% goal (-18.2%)

### 🎯 Next Steps Priority

**Priority 1 (P0):** Stabilize test suite infrastructure

- Fix memory limits and worker configuration
- Resolve mock conflicts (window, AudioContext)
- Fix failing webhook tests

**Priority 2 (P1):** Improve coverage to 60%+

- Test app/ directory routes
- Add component integration tests
- Focus on business-critical service layer

**Priority 3 (P2):** Achieve 95%+ pass rate

- Fix all remaining test failures
- Optimize slow/timeout tests
- Implement proper test isolation

### Final Assessment

**Grade: B+ (87/100)**

The agents successfully created a large volume of high-quality tests and established excellent testing patterns. However, the test suite's stability issues and failure to reach coverage targets prevent a higher grade. The foundation is solid, but additional work is needed to achieve production-ready test quality.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with stabilization phase before adding more tests. Fix the infrastructure issues first, then resume coverage expansion.
