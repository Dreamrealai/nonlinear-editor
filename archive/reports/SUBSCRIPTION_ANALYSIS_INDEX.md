## Key Findings Summary

### Current State

```
Authentication:  ✅ Supabase Auth (Production-Ready)
User Profiles:   ❌ NO custom profile table
Payment Code:    ❌ NO Stripe integration
Settings UI:     ✅ Basic (password only)
Feature Gates:   ❌ NO subscription limits
Database RLS:    ✅ Implemented & secure
```

### What's Missing

1. User profiles table for subscription data
2. Stripe integration (customer, subscription, webhooks)
3. Feature gates and usage limits
4. Billing UI components
5. Usage tracking logic

### Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Database setup (1 day)
- **Phase 2**: Stripe integration (1 day)
- **Phase 3**: Backend APIs (2 days)
- **Phase 4**: Settings UI (1 day)
- **Phase 5**: Feature gates (2 days)
- **Phase 6**: Testing & launch (2-3 days)

**Total: 10-12 days for full implementation**

## Quick Reference: Three-Tier Model

### Free Tier

- 10 min video/month
- 50 AI requests/month
- 5 GB storage
- Basic editing

### Pro Tier ($29/month)

- 500 min video/month
- 2,000 AI requests/month
- 100 GB storage
- AI generation features

### Enterprise Tier (Custom)

- Unlimited everything
- 1 TB storage
- API access
- Team collaboration

---

## Implementation Steps Overview

1. Create `user_profiles` migration
2. Set up Stripe account (test mode)

## Questions & Troubleshooting

### Q: Do we need to change authentication?

**A**: No. Supabase Auth is production-ready and secure. We're only adding a custom user_profiles table.

### Q: What if we want different pricing?

**A**: All tier values are configurable in `/lib/subscriptionTiers.ts`. Change limits and prices easily.

### Q: Can we test without real credit cards?

**A**: Yes! Stripe test mode uses fake cards (4242 4242 4242 4242). Never charge real users during testing.

### Q: How do we handle failed payments?

**A**: Webhook handler automatically updates subscription status to 'past_due'. Add retry logic as needed.

### Q: What about user data privacy?

**A**: All user data is isolated via RLS policies. Each user can only access their own data.
