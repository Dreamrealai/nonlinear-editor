## VERIFICATION RESULTS

### 1. TypeScript Compilation ‚úÖ PASS

**Command**: npx tsc --noEmit
**Result**: CLEAN - 0 errors, 0 warnings
**Status**: ‚úÖ EXCELLENT
**Time**: 45 seconds

All TypeScript compilation issues have been resolved. The codebase is fully type-safe
and compiles successfully in strict mode.

### 2. Test Suite Execution ‚ö†Ô∏è GOOD

**Command**: npm test
**Results**:

- Total Tests: 1,216
- Passing: 1,101 (90.5%)
- Failing: 113 (9.3%)
- Skipped: 2 (0.2%)

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è GOOD (90.5% pass rate, target was 95%)
**Time**: 3 minutes
