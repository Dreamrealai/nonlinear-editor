# October 24, 2025 Session Reports

## Overview

These reports document parallel agent sessions conducted on October 24, 2025 to improve test coverage, stability, and overall code quality.

## Parallel Agent Architecture

Multiple specialized agents worked simultaneously on different aspects of the codebase:

### Agent 1: Initial Assessment

- **Focus:** Codebase analysis and issue identification
- **Output:** `AGENT1_SUMMARY.md`
- **Results:** Identified test gaps and stability issues

### Agent 5: Test Implementation

- **Focus:** Writing comprehensive tests for utilities and API routes
- **Output:** `AGENT5_SUMMARY.md`
- **Results:** Added 500+ lines of test code with 95%+ coverage

### Agent 9: Test Stability

- **Focus:** Fixing flaky tests and improving test reliability
- **Output:** `AGENT9_SUMMARY.md`, `AGENT-9-TEST-STABILITY-REPORT.md`
- **Results:** Fixed timing issues, improved mock patterns

### Agent 10: Test Coverage

- **Focus:** Expanding test coverage to remaining files
- **Output:** `AGENT-10-TEST-COVERAGE-REPORT.md`
- **Results:** Achieved comprehensive coverage across utilities

## Session Accomplishments
