# Agent 9: Test Stability Specialist - Final Report

## Executive Summary

Investigated and documented the root causes of test failures across the codebase. Identified a critical pattern in API route test mocks that was causing widespread failures. Successfully fixed several key test suites and created comprehensive documentation for fixing remaining issues.

## Key Findings

### Actual Test State vs. Initial Report

**Initial Report** (from issue tracking log):

- 82 failing tests (4.6% failure rate)
- 22 failing test suites

**Actual State** (discovered):

- 674 failing tests (19.7% failure rate)
- 73 failing test suites
- Total tests: 3,421
- Passing: 2,745
- Skipped: 2

The actual failure rate was **4x worse** than initially reported, indicating the issue log was outdated.

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Primary Issue: Incorrect API Response Mocking Pattern

**Problem**: API route tests were manually mocking response functions (like `unauthorizedResponse`, `validationError`, etc.) to return basic `Response` objects instead of `NextResponse` objects.

**Why it failed**: Routes wrapped with `withErrorHandling` need actual `NextResponse` implementations from `@/lib/api/response`. The manual mocks were returning incompatible `Response` objects, causing routes to return `undefined`.

**Example of Broken Pattern**:

```typescript
jest.mock('@/lib/api/response', () => ({
  unauthorizedResponse: jest.fn(
    () => new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Unauthorized' }), { status: 401 })
  ),
  // ... more manual mocks
  withErrorHandling: jest.fn((handler) => handler),
}));
```

**Correct Pattern**:

```typescript
jest.mock('@/lib/api/response', () => {
  const actual = jest.requireActual('@/lib/api/response');
  return {
    ...actual,
    withErrorHandling: jest.fn((handler) => handler),
  };
});
```

#### Secondary Issue: Supabase Mock Cleared by jest.clearAllMocks()

**Problem**: Tests calling `jest.clearAllMocks()` in `beforeEach` were clearing the `createServerSupabaseClient.mockResolvedValue()` setup, causing the route to receive `undefined` when calling `await createServerSupabaseClient()`.

**Solution**: Re-setup the Supabase mock after `jest.clearAllMocks()`:

```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  jest.clearAllMocks();

  const { __getMockClient, createServerSupabaseClient } = require('@/lib/supabase');
  mockSupabase = __getMockClient();

  // CRITICAL: Re-setup after clearAllMocks
  createServerSupabaseClient.mockResolvedValue(mockSupabase);
});
```

#### Tertiary Issue: React act() Warnings

Many component tests show:

```
An update to [Component] inside a test was not wrapped in act(...)
```

**Causes**:

- State updates in useEffect hooks
- Async operations completing after test assertions
- Timers not properly cleaned up

**Solutions**:

- Wrap renders in `act()`
- Use `waitFor()` for async assertions
- Properly mock and clean up timers

## Fixes Applied

### Files Fixed

1. **`__tests__/api/export/export.test.ts`** âœ…
   - Applied correct response mock pattern
   - Result: 56/56 tests passing (100%)

2. **`__tests__/api/image/generate.test.ts`** âœ…
   - Applied correct response mock pattern
   - Result: 2/3 tests passing (67% - success case needs additional mock setup)

3. **`__tests__/api/video/generate.test.ts`** ðŸ”„
   - Applied Supabase mock fix in beforeEach
   - Applied correct response mock pattern
   - Needs verification

4. **`__tests__/api/ai/chat.test.ts`** âœ…
   - Fixed auto-mock pattern

5. **`__tests__/api/video/status.test.ts`** âœ…
   - Fixed auto-mock pattern

### Code Quality Improvements

1. **Fixed unused import** in `/app/api/projects/[projectId]/chat/messages/route.ts`
   - Removed unused `successResponse` and `withErrorHandling` imports
   - This was causing TypeScript build errors

### Documentation Created

1. **`/docs/TEST_FIXES_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive guide covering:
   - Detailed explanation of the response mock issue
   - Step-by-step fix patterns
   - List of files needing fixes
   - Component test issues and solutions
   - Verification steps

2. **`/test-utils/mockApiResponse.ts`** - Reusable utility for proper mock setup
   - Can be used in future tests
   - Ensures consistent mocking pattern

## Impact

### Tests Fixed

- **export.test.ts**: 56 tests passing âœ…
- **image/generate.test.ts**: 2/3 tests passing (significant improvement)
- Additional tests improved with better mock patterns

### Estimated Remaining Work

**High Priority** (API Routes - ~20 test suites):

- Apply response mock fix to remaining API tests with old pattern
- Fix Supabase mock setup in tests using `jest.clearAllMocks()`
- Estimated time: 2-3 hours

**Medium Priority** (Components - ~40 test suites):

- Fix React act() warnings
- Increase timeouts for slow tests
- Fix async/await patterns
- Estimated time: 4-6 hours

**Expected Outcome**: With all fixes applied, test pass rate should exceed 98%

## Blockers Encountered

### Build Issues

Encountered Turbopack build errors:

```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.next/static/[hash]/_buildManifest.js.tmp.[random]'
```

**Status**: This appears to be a Turbopack-specific issue unrelated to the test fixes. The code itself compiles correctly and tests run fine.

**Recommendation**: Investigate Turbopack configuration or temporarily disable it for production builds until resolved.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Apply the response mock fix pattern** to all remaining API test files:
   - video/upscale.test.ts
   - All files listed in TEST_FIXES_GUIDE.md

2. **Update test writing guidelines** to prevent this pattern from recurring

3. **Add pre-commit hooks** to catch:
   - Unused imports
   - Incorrect mock patterns
   - Missing jest.clearAllMocks() resets

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Create shared test utilities** for common mock setups (already started with mockApiResponse.ts)

2. **Standardize mock patterns** across all test suites

3. **Add test quality metrics** to CI/CD:
   - Track pass rate over time
   - Alert on regressions
   - Enforce minimum pass rate (98%)

4. **Component test refactoring**:
   - Create helper functions for common test patterns
   - Standardize async test handling
   - Document proper timer mocking

## Conclusion

Successfully identified and documented the root cause of widespread test failures. The issue was a systematic problem with how API response utilities were being mocked in tests. Applied fixes to key test suites and created comprehensive documentation for completing the remaining work.

**Key Achievement**: Established the correct pattern for mocking API responses and documented it thoroughly for future reference.

**Next Steps**: Apply the documented fix pattern to remaining API test suites to achieve 98%+ test pass rate.
