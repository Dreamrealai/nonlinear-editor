## Critical Findings from Round 3

### 1. Test Count Discrepancy (Issue #71)

**Problem:** Conflicting test counts between Agent reports

- Agent 10: 4,300 total tests
- Agent 11 (Archive): 1,774 total tests
- Discrepancy: 2,526 tests (58.7% difference)

**Action Required:** Run full test suite with explicit configuration to establish ground truth

---

### 2. Missing Agent Work (Issue #72)

**Problem:** 4 agents have no completion reports

**Missing:**

- Agent 12: Component Export Fixes (expected +250 tests)
- Agent 14: Edge Case Fixes (expected stability improvement)
- Agent 15: New API Route Tests (expected +200-300 tests)
- Agent 18: Integration Test Enhancements (expected reliability improvement)

**Note:** Agent 12 and Agent 18 reports WERE FOUND during consolidation, but Agent 20 didn't find them. This suggests Agent 14 and possibly Agent 15 may also have completed work without reports.

**Action Required:** Check git history and codebase for evidence of work

---

### 3. withAuth Mock Timeouts (Issue #70)

**Problem:** ~49 test files with withAuth mocks timing out at 10 seconds

**Root Cause:** Promise that never resolves in mock setup

**Impact:** Blocks all API route test development

**Attempted Fixes:**

- ✅ Corrected mock to pass 3 parameters
- ✅ Added missing auditLog and serverLogger mocks
- ❌ Tests still timeout - deeper issue remains

**Action Required:** Git bisect to find when tests broke, try alternative mocking strategies

---

### 4. Component Integration Bugs (Issue #78)

**Discovery:** Agent 18's integration tests finding real bugs

**Status:**

- 22/134 tests passing (16% pass rate)
- 112 tests failing due to real integration issues

**Bugs Found:**

1. Model name mismatches
2. State propagation failures
3. Queue management API format issues
4. Async timing problems

**Value:** These failures are **expected and valuable** - revealing real bugs that unit tests missed

---
