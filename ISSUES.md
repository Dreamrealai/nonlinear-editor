## Quick Reference for Coding Agents

### When Fixing Issues

1. **Always check FEATURES_BACKLOG.md** - Feature requests live there, not here
2. **Update this file minimally** - Only add new bugs/technical debt
3. **Mark issues resolved, don't accumulate** - Remove fixed issues immediately
4. **Follow document protocol** - See CLAUDE.md for document management rules

### Common Patterns (Full docs in `/docs/CODING_BEST_PRACTICES.md`)

**TypeScript:**

```typescript
// Always specify return types
export function calculateDuration(clips: Clip[]): number {
  return clips.reduce((sum, clip) => sum + clip.duration, 0);
}

// Use branded types for IDs
type UserId = string & { __brand: 'UserId' };
```

**API Routes:**

```typescript
export const POST = withAuth(
  async ({ req, userId }) => {
    // Validate inputs
    const body = await req.json();
    validateString(body.name, 'name', 1, 100);

    // Business logic in service layer
    const result = await projectService.create(userId, body);

    return successResponse({ project: result });
  },
  {
    rateLimit: RATE_LIMITS.tier2_generation,
  }
);
```

**Error Handling:**

```typescript
try {
  const result = await operation();
} catch (error) {
  browserLogger.error('Operation failed', { error, context });
  throw new OperationError('User-friendly message');
}
```

**State Management (Zustand):**

```typescript
// Atomic actions with Immer
addClip: (clip: Clip) =>
  set(produce((state) => {
    state.timeline.clips.push(clip);
    state.history.save(); // Undo/redo support
  })),
```

## Historical Context

This tracker previously contained 67 issues (3453 lines). After comprehensive resolution efforts:

- **65 issues resolved** (bugs, technical debt, and missing features)
- **2 feature requests** moved to FEATURES_BACKLOG.md
- **Document reduced by 93%** (3453 → 245 lines) for better readability

**Resolution Timeline:**

- 2025-10-24: Major cleanup effort, 10 subagents + manual work
- 2025-10-24: All P0, P1, P2, P3 issues resolved
- 2025-10-24: Document restructured, features moved to backlog

For detailed implementation notes on resolved issues, see:

- Git commit history (commits from 2025-10-24)
- `/archive/` directory (historical analysis reports)
- `/docs/reports/` directory (technical specifications)

---

## Document Management

**Per CLAUDE.md guidelines:**

- **ISSUES.md** - Active bugs and technical debt ONLY (currently: 0 open)
- **FEATURES_BACKLOG.md** - Feature requests and enhancements (currently: 2 planned + 65 implemented)
- **No duplicate documents** - This is the single source of truth for bugs

**When adding new issues:**

1. Verify it's actually a bug (not a feature request)
2. If feature request → Add to FEATURES_BACKLOG.md
3. If bug → Add here with status "Open"
4. When fixed → Remove immediately (don't accumulate "Fixed" items)

**Keep this document lean!** Aim for <300 lines. Move details to:

- Implementation details → Git commits
- Analysis reports → `/archive/`
- Technical specs → `/docs/reports/`

**Last Major Update:** 2025-10-24 (10 subagents + manual work completed)
**Next Review:** As needed when new bugs are discovered
**Status:** 🎉 **All Clear - Ready for Production**
