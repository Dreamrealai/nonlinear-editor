## HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES (P1)

### Issue #72: Missing Agent Work Verification Needed

**Status:** Open (Discovered by Agent 20)
**Priority:** P1 (High - Unknown completion status)
**Impact:** Unknown if critical fixes were applied
**Reported:** 2025-10-24

**Description:**
Four agents from Round 3 have no completion reports:

- Agent 12: Component Export Fixes (expected +250 tests)
- Agent 14: Edge Case Fixes (expected stability improvement)
- Agent 15: New API Route Tests (expected +200-300 tests)
- Agent 18: Integration Test Enhancements (expected reliability improvement)

**Action Required:**

1. Check git history for evidence of work
2. Search codebase for expected changes
3. Verify if component export patterns were applied
4. Confirm if new API route tests were created
5. Document findings

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

### Issue #75: API Route Tests - Alternative Integration Testing Approach

**Status:** ⚠️ Solution Designed - Awaiting Approval (Agent 29)
**Priority:** P1 (Medium-High - API reliability)
**Impact:** Alternative to complex mocking, eliminates P0 timeout risk
**Location:** `__tests__/api/`
**Reported:** 2025-10-24
**Updated:** 2025-10-24 (Agent 29 evaluation)

**Original Issue:**
Two API route test files have withAuth pattern correctly applied but still fail:

1. `__tests__/api/payments/checkout.test.ts` - Needs Stripe service mocks
2. `__tests__/api/ai/chat.test.ts` - Needs comprehensive review

**Solution Designed:**
Use test implementations instead of mocks:

- ✅ Test auth wrapper (no withAuth mocking)
- ✅ Test Supabase client with in-memory database
- ✅ Real service layer execution
- ✅ Only mock external services (Stripe, Google Cloud, AI APIs)

**Benefits:**

- 71% fewer mocks (7 → 2 per test)
- 55% less code (90 → 40 lines per test)
- 95% real logic tested (vs 30% with mocks)
- Eliminates withAuth timeout issues

**Deliverables Created:**

1. `/test-utils/testWithAuth.ts` - Test auth wrapper and in-memory DB
2. `/test-utils/apiIntegration.ts` - Integration test utilities
3. `/docs/INTEGRATION_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive guide
4. Example: `/__tests__/api/analytics/web-vitals.integration.test.ts` (9/9 passing ✅)

**Estimated Effort:** 43-63 hours for full migration (can be parallelized)

### Issue #76: Component Tests - AudioWaveform Async/Timing Issues

**Status:** Partially Fixed (Agent 15)
**Priority:** P1 (Medium - Component reliability)
**Impact:** 41% of AudioWaveform tests still failing
**Location:** `__tests__/components/AudioWaveform.test.tsx`
**Reported:** 2025-10-24

**Description:**
AudioWaveform component tests improved from 10% → 59% pass rate, but 12 tests still failing.

**Progress:**

- ✅ Added Worker mock
- ✅ Improved AudioContext mock
- ✅ Fixed 14 tests (+467% improvement)
- ⚠️ 12 tests still failing

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours for AudioWaveform completion, 8-10 hours to apply patterns across 53 other component test files

---

### Issue #77: Services with Low Coverage Need Improvement

**Status:** Open
**Priority:** P1 (Medium - Quality improvement)
**Impact:** Two services below 70% coverage target
**Location:** `/lib/services/`
**Reported:** 2025-10-24

**Description:**
Two services need coverage improvement:

1. achievementService - No test file exists
2. thumbnailService - 32.53% coverage (needs error paths)

**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours
**Expected Impact:** +70-90 tests, coverage to 80%+

---

### Issue #78: Component Integration Tests Revealing Real Bugs

**Status:** In Progress (Critical bugs fixed, foundation established)
**Priority:** P1 (Medium - Quality assurance)
**Impact:** 112 new integration tests finding real bugs
**Location:** `__tests__/components/integration/*.test.tsx`
**Reported:** 2025-10-24
**Updated:** 2025-10-24 (Agent 25)

**Current Status:**

- **After Agent 25**: 26 tests passing (19% pass rate)
- 108 tests still failing (bugs identified and categorized)

**Bugs Fixed:**

1. ✅ HTML Violation: Nested button in VideoGenerationForm
2. ✅ Model Name Mismatches
3. ✅ API Mocking Pattern

**Remaining Work Categories:**

1. Query Selector Ambiguity (18 tests) - 2-3h
2. API Mocking Incomplete (15 tests) - 3-4h
3. Zustand Store State (20 tests) - 2-3h
4. Act Warnings (multiple tests) - 2-3h

**Estimated Effort Remaining:** 12-15 hours
**Expected Final Impact:** +50-55 tests (26 → 76-81, ~60% pass rate)

## MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES (P2)

### Issue #80: Test Execution Time and Flakiness Not Monitored

**Status:** Open
**Priority:** P2 (Medium - Test quality)
**Impact:** Unknown test stability and performance
**Reported:** 2025-10-24

**Description:**
No monitoring for:

- Flaky tests (tests that fail intermittently)
- Test execution time variance
- Slow tests identification
- Performance trends

**Recommendation:**

1. Implement flaky test detection
2. Track test execution time per test
3. Set up alerts for slow tests (>5s)
4. Monitor pass rate trends over time

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours

---

## LOW PRIORITY ISSUES (P3)

### Issue #83: Legacy Test Utilities Should Be Deprecated

**Status:** Open
**Priority:** P3 (Low - Technical debt)
**Impact:** Maintenance burden, confusion
**Location:** `/test-utils/legacy-helpers/`
**Reported:** 2025-10-24

**Description:**
Legacy helpers remain in use alongside modern utilities, causing duplication and confusion.

**Recommendation:**

1. New tests use modern utilities (immediate)
2. Migrate tests as they're modified (gradual)
3. Deprecate legacy after 3-6 months
4. Remove legacy after full migration

**Estimated Effort:** 20-30 hours over 3-6 months

---

### Issue #84: Test Documentation Needs Updates

**Status:** Partial (Agent 19 created TESTING_UTILITIES.md)
**Priority:** P3 (Low - Documentation)
**Impact:** Onboarding friction
**Reported:** 2025-10-24

**Description:**
Testing docs need updates with Round 3 lessons:

- `/docs/TESTING_BEST_PRACTICES.md` - Needs Round 3 lessons
- Test maintenance runbook - Doesn't exist
- Troubleshooting guide - Doesn't exist

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

---

### Issue #85: Google Cloud Storage Test Should Be Skipped or Better Mocked

**Status:** Open
**Priority:** P3 (Low - Single test)
**Impact:** 1 integration test failing
**Location:** `__tests__/integration/video-generation-flow.test.ts`
**Reported:** 2025-10-24

**Description:**
One integration test attempts to use actual Google Cloud Storage credentials and fails.

**Recommendation:**
Either skip this test, mock GCS completely, or move to E2E test suite.

**Estimated Effort:** 30 minutes
